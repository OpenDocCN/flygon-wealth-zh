- en: When I was applying to colleges, my dad told me that I was not allowed to complete
    the FAFSA—the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Not because my family
    was ultra wealthy, or anything—we were solidly middle-class. My parents had big
    expectations for me in college, and loans would’ve made that massive education
    bill a lot easier to stomach.

    sitting on a pile of cash (literally or figuratively) is not going to get you
    rich, because it prevents your money from making you money—but how are regular
    people supposed to find that out? Your family may have been wary of investing
    their money or using a bank due to fear of fraud or being scammed, because they
    weren’t aware, for example, that deposits are FDIC insured (aka backed by the
    government) or that there are lower-risk investment options than just buying a
    single company’s stock. They may not have known how to get started, and therefore
    felt more comfortable hoarding their wealth instead of puzzling out how to set
    up a brokerage account. They may have assumed all investing is either “playing
    the stock market” or “giving twenty grand to Uncle Tony’s friend to get his new

    something that *isn’t* the cheapest thing on the menu. So, while yes, I *highly*
    recommend you talk to a therapist, you also need to be making active decisions
    to grow your wealth instead of just hoarding it or frittering it away.'

  zh: 一：心理治疗很棒。我强烈推荐每个人都真正解开一些内心深处的问题。但重要的是要记住，你摆脱这种稀缺心态的方式与摆脱任何坏习惯的方式是一样的。你需要随着时间积极改变你的思维和行为。也许是在早上对着镜子说肯定的话，也许是在工作中每年都坚定地谈判要更多的钱，也许是强迫自己点一道*不是*菜单上最便宜的东西。所以，虽然是的，我*强烈*建议你去找心理治疗师交谈，但你也需要做出积极的决定来增加你的财富，而不仅仅是囤积或挥霍它。

    you make more money. I know, it’s like, “No shit, Vivian,” but don’t discount
    how much increasing your earning can lift the burden of deep-seated money stress.
    It’s not “mo money, mo problems” but “mo money, mo opportunities . . . and a lot
    less problems too.”'

- en: I wanted to share these solid-gold truths with you because the not-so-solid,
    scarcity-and-fear-based mindsets they’re taking down? Those mindsets don’t arise
    in a vacuum. These are toxic thoughts that arise when people are stuck in toxic
    systems of oppression for year upon year. And these generational patterns and
    systemic inequalities? That’s why we all need to be Rich AF.

- en: Closing wealth gaps across communities will take more than just individual action,
    of course—we’ll need to enact legislative change, provide public personal finance
    education, and support historically disadvantaged communities. But the good news
    is, when we overcome these kinds of financial inequality, we all win.
