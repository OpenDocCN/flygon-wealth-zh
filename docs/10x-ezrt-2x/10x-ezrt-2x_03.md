**— ATTRIBUTED TO MARTHA BECK^(1) - 归属于 MARTHA BECK ^(1)**

Fresh out of college, Chad Willardson was 24 years old when he was accepted into the financial advisor training at Merrill Lynch. Chad was one of 100 trainees in Southern California who started the program and one of two who completed the program successfully. 刚从大学毕业的查德·威拉德森 24 岁时被美林公司接受了财务顾问培训。查德是南加州 100 名学员之一，也是成功完成该项目的两名学员之一。

It was a brutal and intense growth curve. 这是一个残酷而激烈的增长曲线。

The purpose of the training was to teach aspiring new advisors how to both invest in and attract new clients, as well as to reach $15 million under management within 18 months. Anyone who did not achieve all the certifications plus the $15 million hurdle was dropped from the program without a job. 培训的目的是教导有抱负的新顾问如何投资和吸引新客户，以及在 18 个月内达到 1500 万美元的管理。任何没有获得所有认证和 1500 万美元障碍的人都被从该计划中除名，没有工作。

Trainees were young and most investors preferred an experienced wealth advisor. Who was willing to let an inexperienced young kid manage their money? 学员都是年轻人，大多数投资者更喜欢经验丰富的财富顾问。谁会愿意让一个没经验的小孩子来管理自己的钱？

Early in this process, Chad told his manager and some of the senior advisors at the firm that he would aim to only work with clients with more than $100,000 to invest. His manager replied that getting any client willing to invest $100,000 would be literally impossible. No one with that amount of money (this was 20 years ago) would trust someone Chad’s age. 在这个过程的早期，Chad 告诉他的经理和公司的一些高级顾问，他的目标是只与投资超过 10 万美元的客户合作。他的经理回答说，让任何客户愿意投资 10 万美元是不可能的。没有人有那么多钱（这是 20 年前）会相信乍得这个年龄的人。

Focused on his own standards rather than someone else’s, Chad committed to himself that he wouldn’t work with anyone with less than $100,000 for him to manage. 查德专注于自己的标准，而不是别人的标准，他对自己承诺，他不会与任何少于 10 万美元的人合作。

For months, Chad was the first person in the office each day, arriving to work before sunrise, and the last to leave. He spent hours studying and passing big exams and certifications, reaching out to countless business owners in the area to build relationships, and reading business, wealth management, and personal development books. While the other advisors and trainees were at the bar drinking and partying on their nights and weekends, Chad was putting in that extra work. 几个月来，查德每天都是第一个到办公室的人，在日出前到达工作，最后一个离开。他花了几个小时学习和通过大型考试和认证，接触该地区无数的企业主建立关系，阅读商业，财富管理和个人发展书籍。当其他顾问和受训人员晚上和周末在酒吧喝酒和聚会时，查德正在投入额外的工作。

For his first six months he made hundreds of calls every day and experienced nothing but rejection. He didn’t land a single new client. 在他的头六个月里，他每天打几百个电话，除了被拒绝之外什么都没有。他一个新客户都没找到。

Six months into the training program, Chad received a surprising phone call from a man Chad had cold-called six months previously. Ready to retire, the caller had over $600,000 to roll over into a retirement investment account. Remembering their positive phone conversation and Chad’s multiple follow-up outreaches, he wanted Chad to be his wealth advisor. 在培训计划进行了六个月后，查德接到了一个令人惊讶的电话，来自查德六个月前打过电话的一个男人。准备退休时，打电话的人有超过 60 万美元可以转入退休投资账户。想起他们积极的电话交谈和查德的多次后续接触，他希望查德成为他的财富顾问。

Chad’s *first client* had $600,000, six times more than what his manager said would be an impossible minimum standard. This boosted Chad’s confidence and resolve to keep going. During the next several months, Chad took on plenty of clients—all with more than $100,000 for him to manage. 查德的第一个客户有 60 万美元，比他的经理所说的不可能的最低标准高出 6 倍。这增强了乍得继续前进的信心和决心。在接下来的几个月里，查德接待了大量的客户--所有的客户都有超过 10 万美元的资金需要他管理。

Shortly after his first year in the program, he *raised his minimum standard* for new clients from $100,000 to $250,000. 在该项目的第一年后不久，他将新客户的最低标准从 10 万美元提高到 25 万美元。

From that moment forward, he would not take on anyone with less than $250,000 to invest. 从那一刻起，他不会再接受任何低于 25 万美元的投资者。

He got what he focused on. 他得到了他专注的东西。

He developed mastery at the level of his standard and focus. 他在他的标准和重点水平上发展了精通。

By the time the 18-month program ended in 2005, Chad had more than doubled the trainee graduation hurdle and had $30 million under management. 到这个为期 18 个月的项目于 2005 年结束时，乍得已经将实习生的毕业门槛提高了一倍多，管理着 3000 万美元。

During the next seven years, Chad added another $280 million under management, reaching the top 2 percent of advisors (and one of the fastest-growing) with Merrill Lynch. At that point, companies like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and UBS were recruiting Chad and offering more than $4 million cash as a signing bonus! 在接下来的七年里，Chad 又增加了 2.8 亿美元的管理，达到了梅里尔公司前 2%的顾问（也是增长最快的顾问之一）。当时，摩根士丹利、高盛和瑞银等公司都在招募查德，并提供了超过 400 万美元的现金作为签约奖金！

But Chad sensed the future of advising high-wealth entrepreneurs would not be under the umbrella of any of those firms, including the one he worked for. 但查德感觉到，为高财富企业家提供咨询的未来不会在任何一家公司的保护下，包括他工作的那家公司。

Chad’s spectacular 10x growth occurred by developing a unique level of mastery in understanding and supporting his entrepreneurial clients. He wanted to 10x this level of mastery even further, with even higher-level clients with bigger challenges to support. He saw that the only way he’d have the freedom to help the level of clients he wanted at the level of service he wanted—offering them options and solutions beyond a specific firm’s umbrella—was to open his own private fiduciary wealth advisory firm. Chad 的惊人增长是因为他在理解和支持他的创业客户方面拥有独特的水平。他希望进一步提高 10 倍这个水平的掌握程度，更高级别的客户需要支持更大的挑战。他意识到，要想让他自由地以他想要的服务水平帮助他想要的客户的唯一方法就是开一家私人信托财富咨询公司，为他们提供超出特定公司范围的选择和解决方案。

Already in the elite class of a nationwide financial firm after nine years, he summoned the commitment and courage to completely start over and go back to zero. He let go of a cushy and prestigious position that had become 2x, not 10x. 九年后，他已经进入了一家全国性金融公司的精英阶层，他鼓起了决心和勇气，完全重新开始，回到零。他放弃了一个轻松而有声望的职位，这个职位已经变成了 2 倍，而不是 10 倍。

When Chad opened Pacific Capital in 2011, he committed his focus to working exclusively with high-growth entrepreneurs who were millionaires or multimillionaires. He committed to become more niche and specific in who he served and how he helped them. 当 Chad 在 2011 年开设 Pacific Capital 时，他致力于专注于与百万富翁或千万富翁的高成长企业家合作。他承诺在他服务的对象和如何帮助他们方面变得更加小众和具体。

Starting again from scratch, Chad focused on quality, not quantity. 从零开始，乍得注重质量，而不是数量。

To provide the best and most nuanced support, he couldn’t cast a wide net. He had to clarify the specific whales he wanted to help, and how he would create 10x value for them differently from any other financial firm. 为了提供最好最细致的支持，他不能撒网。他必须澄清他想帮助的具体鲸鱼，以及他将如何为它们创造 10 倍的价值，与其他金融公司不同。

The minimum standard at Pacific Capital’s inception was entrepreneurs with a minimum of $1 million to invest and grow. 太平洋资本成立之初的最低标准是企业家至少有 100 万美元的投资和成长。

Chad’s goal shaped his focus and mastery. His 20 percent now was radically different and more specific than the 20 percent of his previous 10x jumps that had gotten him here. Rather than cold-calling, hosting seminars, or walking business to businesses as he had before, he joined networks of entrepreneurs who were already successful and leveraged the reputation he had built in the industry. 查德的目标塑造了他的专注和掌握能力。他现在的 20%与他之前的 10 倍跳跃中的 20%完全不同，也更具体。他不再像以前那样打电话、主持研讨会或步行到企业，而是加入了那些已经成功的企业家的网络，并利用他在行业中建立的声誉。

From 2012–2017, Chad went from starting over to having $300+ million in assets under management. As of this writing, Chad personally manages over $1 billion, with a very strict focus on eight- and nine-figure entrepreneurs. He 10x’d by continually raising his minimum standard and by elevating himself and his value to the level of his rising standards. 从 2012 年到 2017 年，乍得从重新开始到管理 3 亿多美元的资产。在撰写本文时，Chad 个人管理着超过 10 亿美元的资金，非常专注于 8 位数和 9 位数的企业家。他通过不断提高自己的最低标准，并通过将自己和自己的价值提升到他不断提高的标准的水平来获得了 10 倍。

In 2021, he rose his minimum standard new client from $1,000,000 to $2,500,000. 2021 年，他将新客户的最低标准从 100 万美元提高至 250 万美元。

In 2022, he rose his minimum standard new client from $2,500,000 to $5,000,000. 2022 年，他将新客户的最低标准从 250 万美元提高到 500 万美元。

In 2023, he rose his minimum standard new client from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. 2023 年，他将新客户的最低标准从 500 万美元提高到 1000 万美元。

His focus and optimization are getting clearer and clearer. 他的重点和优化越来越清晰。

Chad reaches impossible goals by continually eliminating his 80 percent. Chad 通过不断地消除他的 80%来达到不可能的目标。

Chad doesn’t just raise the standard for his clients. He also raises the standard for himself. Each year, he takes on *fewer clients*, but the value of each client is 10x the average of his former clients. Moreover, the value and impact Chad provides these whales is far more unique and precise than when he was working with a broader range of clients. He knows that achieving more does not mean doing more. 查德不仅仅是为客户提高标准。他也提高了自己的标准。每年，他接的客户越来越少，但每个客户的价值是他以前客户平均值的 10 倍。此外，乍得提供这些鲸鱼的价值和影响远比他与更广泛的客户合作时更加独特和精确。他知道，做得更多并不意味着做得更多。

Similar to Linda McKissack in the previous chapter, a crucial aspect of Chad’s ascension and ability to 10x is his momentum. Unlike many financial advisors, Chad is also an entrepreneur, with multiple companies, ventures, and investments. He’s continually 10xing himself such that even his biggest clients are simply trying to keep up with Chad’s exponentially elevating lifestyle and financial standards. He’s living by example, not offering broad and cookie-cutter theory or products. 与上一章中的琳达·麦基萨克相似，查德 Ascension 和 10 倍能力的一个关键方面是他的动力。与许多财务顾问不同的是，Chad 也是一位企业家，拥有多家公司、合资企业和投资。他不断地自我调整，以至于即使是他最大的客户也只是试图跟上乍得指数级提升的生活方式和财务标准。他以榜样为生活，而不是提供广泛和千篇一律的理论或产品。

All the while, Chad figures out how to do less. Throughout Chad’s 10x growth and evolution, he hired a full-time executive assistant and a large team of financial specialists to support him and his clients. His executive assistant took over all of his email, scheduling, phone calls, and all other logistical aspects of Chad’s business and personal life. Chad’s team of experts at Pacific Capital took over all client meetings, day-to-day operations, investment management, and strategic financial planning for clients. 一直以来，查德都在想办法少做些什么。在乍得 10 倍的增长和演变过程中，他聘请了一名全职行政助理和一个庞大的金融专家团队来支持他和他的客户。他的行政助理接管了他所有的电子邮件，日程安排，电话，以及乍得商业和个人生活的所有其他后勤方面。乍得在太平洋资本的专家团队接管了所有客户会议、日常运营、投资管理和客户战略财务规划。

Chad used to spend over 200 long days in the office each year. Now he doesn’t even have his own office inside the Pacific Capital building. He goes in about 30 days per year to connect with the team, share vision, and provide any support he can. 乍得过去每年要在办公室里度过 200 多天。现在他甚至没有自己的办公室在太平洋资本大厦。他每年约有 30 天与团队联系，分享愿景，并提供他所能提供的任何支持。

Chad’s time used to be spent on literally dozens of different tasks and activities. Now it’s invested in a limited few, which he does uniquely better than anyone else in the world. 乍得的时间过去花在几十个不同的任务和活动上。现在它投资在有限的少数人身上，他比世界上任何人都做得更好。

Higher quality, less quantity. 质量更高，数量更少。

Yet, despite doing less, Chad’s productivity—meaning his *tangible results*—has shot through the roof. He’s nearly doubling his business each year while working less. He’s published three books in the past three years and taken more vacations in the past few years than he did in the previous few decades. 然而，尽管做得很少，乍得的生产力--意味着他实实在在的成果--已经飙升。他的生意每年几乎翻了一番，而工作量却更少。在过去的三年里，他出版了三本书，在过去的几年里，他休假的次数比过去几十年还要多。

To quote the 10x thinker, Greg McKeown, “An Essentialist produces more—brings forth more—by removing more instead of doing more.”^(2) 引用 10 倍思想家格雷格·麦基翁（Greg McKeown）的话说：“一个本质主义者通过去除更多而不是做更多而产生更多。” ^(2)

To go 10x, you simplify your focus by continually letting go of *everything* that doesn’t meet your 10x filter. Each time you go 10x, the filter gets finer and finer, letting less pass through. 要达到 10 倍，你可以通过不断地放弃不符合 10 倍过滤条件的所有内容来简化你的关注。每次你去 10 倍，过滤器会变得越来越细，让更少的通过。

Most entrepreneurs don’t achieve the same kind of growth because they shut down when they encounter resistance. When Chad stopped handholding his clients through the day-to-day, a few of his clients and friends questioned the decision. They wondered why Chad wasn’t involved at every touch point and some legacy long-time clients were bothered by the initial changes. They wanted Chad to keep things as they had always been. They didn’t like Chad elevating his standards and vision. These clients were 2x, not 10x. 大多数企业家没有实现同样的增长，因为他们遇到阻力时就会关门。当查德不再在日常生活中牵着他的客户时，他的一些客户和朋友质疑这个决定。他们想知道为什么查德没有参与到每个接触点，一些传统的长期客户对最初的变化感到困扰。他们希望查德能像往常一样保持一切。他们不喜欢查德提高他的标准和视野。这些客户是 2 倍，而不是 10 倍。

Ironically, Chad had actually made himself *more available* by removing the 80 percent of minutia that kept him absurdly busy and without space to connect and be present. Continually freeing himself from his 80 percent enables him to focus on his highest form of contribution—helping his clients elevate their vision and commitment, and supporting them when they began to falter from that commitment. 具有讽刺意味的是，查德实际上通过删除 80%的细节使自己更容易获得，这些细节让他荒谬地忙碌，没有空间联系和在场。不断地把自己从 80%的收入中解放出来，使他能够专注于他的最高贡献--帮助客户提升他们的愿景和承诺，并在他们开始动摇承诺时给予支持。

Chad’s 10x clients recognized and appreciated Chad’s evolution because they felt its effects. He was helping them expand their own vision and standards, and they were becoming far more successful and happier by following his example and guidance. Chad 的 10x 客户认可并赞赏 Chad 的演变，因为他们感受到了它的影响。他正在帮助他们扩展自己的视野和标准，他们通过跟随他的榜样和指导变得更加成功和快乐。

Anytime someone wants you to remain as you are, they do so for their own self-preservation. Your evolution threatens their current security, and they want that security more than the freedom that you seek. It’s plain uncomfortable at first. This is one of the most common reasons people and entrepreneurs don’t go 10x. They know it will make *those around them* feel uncomfortable for a time. To avoid this discomfort in themselves and those closest to them, people opt for 2x, not 10x. 任何时候，有人希望你保持原样，他们这样做是为了他们自己的自我保护。你们的进化威胁着他们当前的安全，他们想要的是那种安全，而不是你们所寻求的自由。一开始很不舒服。这是人们和企业家不去 10 倍的最常见原因之一。他们知道这会让他们周围的人感到一段时间不舒服。为了避免自己和最亲近的人的不适，人们选择 2 倍，而不是 10 倍。

As you radically evolve through the 10x process, many people in your life won’t comprehend the evolution you’ve experienced. It will defy logic and reality to them, and therefore they will disregard or entirely avoid seeing the changes you’ve made. 10x can indeed repel 2x. 当你通过 10 倍的过程彻底进化时，你生活中的许多人不会理解你所经历的进化。这将违背逻辑和现实对他们来说，因此他们将无视或完全避免看到你所做的改变。10x 确实可以排斥 2x。

By embracing the 10x process, you’ll evolve internally and externally far more than the average person, although the 10x process is *available to all people* who choose freedom over security. 通过拥抱 10 倍过程，你的内部和外部将远远超过普通人，尽管 10 倍过程适用于所有选择自由而不是安全的人。

Most people are afraid to shed old standards and strategies—especially ones that worked. What makes Chad different? 大多数人都害怕放弃旧的标准和策略尤其是那些行之有效的。是什么让查德与众不同？

Chad exhibits a quality that only the world’s top achievers do: *the ability to rapidly accept a new identity.* 查德展现出只有世界顶尖成就者才具备的品质：快速接受新身份的能力。

He let go of being the guy who made hundreds of cold calls a day. He let go of being the first in the office and the last to leave. He let go of being one of the top dogs at one of the biggest financial firms in the world. He let go of needing to always be available and look fancy in a suit. He let go of being the guy who answered his own emails, attended client meetings, or even had his own office. He let go of seeing busyness as a status symbol. He let go of trying to please anyone that wasn’t in his 20 percent. 他不再是那个每天打几百个电话的人了。他放下了第一个到办公室，最后一个离开的念头。他放弃了世界上最大的金融公司之一的顶级人物之一。他放下了总是有空的需要，穿上西装看起来很花哨。他放弃了自己回复邮件、参加客户会议、甚至拥有自己办公室的人。他不再把忙碌视为身份的象征。他不再试图取悦任何不在他 20%的人。

None of the things he let go of were bad. Indeed, many of them were crucial aspects in Chad getting where he had gotten. Yet, to continually expand and 10x himself, he had to evolve beyond his then identity (the 80 percent) and embrace a new vision and standard (the 20 percent). 他放弃的东西没有一件是坏的。事实上，他们中的许多是乍得取得他所得到的关键方面。然而，为了不断扩大自己，他必须超越当时的身份（80%），拥抱新的愿景和标准（20%）。

Committing fully to your next 20 percent is embracing a 10x identity wherein you transform yourself and your life through an exciting future. 全力投入你接下来的 20%就是拥抱一个 10 倍的身份，在这个身份中，你可以通过一个令人兴奋的未来来改变自己和你的生活。

Holding on to the 80 percent is embracing a 2x identity wherein you avoid major changes and maintain your status quo. 坚持 80%就是拥抱一个 2 倍的身份，在这个身份中，你可以避免重大变化，保持现状。

To go 10x again and again, Chad shed the identity that got him here for the identity that would get him there. 为了一次又一次地去 10 倍，查德摆脱了让他在这里的身份，为了让他在那里的身份。

Once something became 2x, he let that 80 percent go, passing it off to a capable Who or eliminating it altogether. He further simplified his life down to the 10x standard which most excited him, choosing an increasingly niche and nuanced 20 percent focus and mastery. 一旦某样东西变成了 2 倍，他就放弃了这 80%，把它交给一个有能力的人，或者完全消除它。他进一步简化了自己的生活，最让他兴奋的是 10 倍标准，选择了一个越来越小众的细分市场，20%的专注度和掌握度。

Your identity is fundamentally two things: it’s 1) the story or narrative you have for yourself, and it’s 2) the standards or commitments you hold for yourself.^(3) The scientific definition of *identity* is “a well-organized conception of the self, consisting of values and beliefs to which the individual is solidly committed.”^(4) 你的身份基本上是两件事：它是 1）你为自己准备的故事或叙述，2）你为自己所坚持的标准或承诺。 ^(3) 认同的科学定义是“一个组织良好的自我概念，由个人坚定地致力于的价值观和信念组成。 ^(4)

Put simply, your identity as a person is *what you’re most committed to*. It’s the story about yourself you’re committed to, and it’s the personal standards you’re most committed to. 简单地说，你作为一个人的身份是你最致力于的。这是你致力于的关于你自己的故事，这是你最致力于的个人标准。

A *standard* is a level of quality and norm you set for yourself. When something is truly a standard, *it’s a commitment*. You rarely if ever go outside or below your floor or minimum standard; otherwise it wouldn’t be a standard. 标准是你为自己设定的质量水平和规范。当一件事真正成为标准时，它就是一种承诺。你很少去外面或低于你的地板或最低标准;否则就不是标准了。

We are all committed to standards that we’ve set for ourselves, even if we don’t realize it. Take for example, my friend who is an avid World of Warcraft player. He invests about 16 hours per day playing and is one of the top players on his online server. Recently, he told me he left his guild, the online community he was a part of. 我们都致力于为自己设定的标准，即使我们没有意识到。举个例子，我的朋友是一个狂热的魔兽世界玩家。他每天投入大约 16 个小时玩游戏，是他在线服务器上的顶级玩家之一。最近，他告诉我，他离开了他的公会，他是一个在线社区的一部分。

“Why did you leave?” I asked. “你怎么走了？“我问。

“They weren’t up to my standard,” he replied. “I want to play with more serious players.” “他们达不到我的标准，”他回答。“我想和更认真的球员一起踢球。”

Although you may not be interested in online video games, and neither am I, the point is that we all have standards we choose for ourselves. We choose the standards we care about as well as the level we hold those standards to. For instance, two people may be equally committed to tennis though one may be professional and the other an amateur—the pro having much higher standards for their playing than the other. 虽然你可能对在线视频游戏不感兴趣，我也不感兴趣，但关键是我们都有自己选择的标准。我们选择我们关心的标准以及我们坚持这些标准的水平。例如，两个人可能同样致力于网球，尽管一个可能是职业选手，另一个可能是业余选手--职业选手对他们的比赛有更高的标准。

Elevating and committing to specific standards is how you evolve your identity. Elevating your standards and 10xing yourself involves a process outlined in Dan Sullivan’s *The 4 C’s Formula*: 提升和承诺特定的标准是你发展身份的方式。提升你的标准和自我改进涉及丹·沙利文的《4C 公式》中概述的一个过程：

1.  Commitment 承诺
2.  Courage 勇气
3.  Capability 能力
4.  Confidence 信心

Nothing happens until you commit. 什么都不会发生，直到你承诺。

As you *commit* to a specific standard far above your current capability and confidence, it pushes you outside your knowledge and comfort zone: hence, *courage*. 当你致力于一个远远超出你当前能力和信心的特定标准时，它会把你推到你的知识和舒适区之外：因此，勇气。

Through courageously adapting toward your commitment, you experience many “losses” and failures along the way, which you can utilize as feedback and learning. By adapting and applying your learning, you develop *capabilities* and skills you previously didn’t have, which you would not have developed without having fully made the commitment. 通过勇敢地适应你的承诺，你会经历许多“损失”和失败，你可以利用这些作为反馈和学习。通过适应和应用你的学习，你发展了你以前没有的能力和技能，如果没有充分的承诺，你是不会发展的。

Commitment leads to mastery, wherein you’ve *normalized* the new standard. At this level, you have a higher degree of *confidence*.^(5) 承诺会导致精通，在那里你已经规范了新的标准。在这个层次上，你有更高的信心。 ^(5)

You’re now your 10x self, and it’s completely normal to you, despite the fact that both who you now are and your normal life are unfathomable to your past self. With a higher degree of confidence, you now see and attract bigger and better opportunities, which previously weren’t available to you, enabling you to start the 4C’s cycle anew by making the next level 10x commitment. 你现在是你的 10 倍，这对你来说是完全正常的，尽管事实上，无论你现在是谁，你的正常生活对你过去的自己来说都是深不可测的。有了更高的信心，你现在看到并吸引了更大更好的机会，这是以前你无法获得的，使你能够通过做出下一个级别的 10 倍承诺重新开始 4C 的周期。

Letting go of 80 percent of your identity (including activities, situations, and people) can feel like an enormous loss. Letting go of who you’ve been, how people have seen you, and how others have related to you can feel like you’re losing a big part of yourself. 放弃你 80%的身份（包括活动、情境和人）可能会让你感觉是一种巨大的损失。放下你曾经是谁，人们如何看待你，以及其他人如何与你联系，你会觉得你失去了很大一部分自己。

According to Prospect Theory, humans have an enormous *aversion to loss*.^(6) We fear and avoid loss far more than we seek gain. Loss aversion primarily manifests itself in three specific forms—1) continuing to invest in something unprofitable simply because you’ve already invested in it (i.e., sunk cost bias)^(,7,8) 2) overvaluing something you own, believe, or have created simply because it’s yours (i.e., endowment effect)^(,9,10,11) and 3) continuing to do something you’ve previously done in order to be viewed by yourself and others as consistent (i.e., consistency principle).^(12,13,14) 根据前景理论，人类对损失有着巨大的厌恶。我们害怕和避免损失远远超过我们追求收益。损失厌恶主要表现在三种具体形式-1）继续投资于无利可图的东西，仅仅因为你已经投资了（即，沉没成本偏见） ^(,7,8) 2）高估你拥有、相信或创造的东西，仅仅因为它是你的（即，禀赋效应） ^(,9,10,11) 和 3）继续做你以前做过的事情，以便自己和别人都认为是一致的（即，一致性原则）。 ^(12,13,14)

All of these loss aversion tactics make it extremely hard to let go of the 80 percent. Thus, it’s hard to let go of your current or former identity. 所有这些规避损失的策略都让你很难放弃这 80%。因此，很难放弃你现在或以前的身份。

Elevating your standards is not easy by any means. It’s certainly much, much easier than continuing on a path just because that’s what you’ve been doing (i.e., 2x thinking). 提高你的标准无论如何都不容易。这肯定比仅仅因为你一直在做的事情而继续走下去容易得多（即，2x 思考）。

To go 10x, you live based on freedom. You choose the standards *you want* because that’s what you intrinsically want, and you’re not worried about other people’s opinions. You flexibly evolve your identity, letting go of things that once made up a core component of who you were. 10 倍，你生活在自由的基础上。你选择你想要的标准，因为这是你内在想要的，你不担心别人的意见。你灵活地发展你的身份，放弃那些曾经构成你是谁的核心组成部分的东西。

It takes enormous commitment and courage to raise your minimum standard, yet it’s how you evolve yourself as a person. As Chad did when he committed to only working with clients with $100,000 or more to invest, for a period of time, you’ll struggle reaching and clawing toward your new commitment, with many bumps and bruises along the way. This is the commitment and courage phase of Dan’s 4C’s. But over time, you’ll evolve yourself, your knowledge, and your capabilities until it becomes second nature to you. 提高你的最低标准需要巨大的承诺和勇气，但这是你如何发展自己作为一个人。就像查德承诺只与投资 10 万美元或更多的客户合作一样，在一段时间内，你会很难达到和抓住你的新承诺，一路上会遇到许多坎坷和瘀伤。这是丹 4C 的承诺和勇气阶段。但随着时间的推移，你会进化你自己，你的知识和你的能力，直到它成为你的第二天性。

Elevating your identity and standards is primarily *emotional* and thus qualitative, which is why *psychological flexibility* is so crucial to 10xing. To be psychologically flexible, you become increasingly comfortable and adaptive to situations and challenges which are initially uncomfortable to you. You see yourself as a context, not the content of your thoughts and emotions. As you evolve and expand yourself as a context, the content of your life—inside and out—simultaneously changes as well.^(15,16) 提升你的身份和标准主要是情感上的，因此是质的，这就是为什么心理灵活性对 10 星如此重要。心理上的灵活性，你会变得越来越舒适，适应那些最初让你感到不舒服的情况和挑战。你把自己看作是一个背景，而不是你思想和情绪的内容。当你进化和扩展自己作为一个背景，你生活的内容--内在和外在--也会同时改变。 ^(15,16)

You *commit* to the standards you want, even when it’s uncomfortable for a brief time. By embracing your emotions rather than suppressing them, your identity quickly adapts to your new standards and you reach a place of *acceptance*.^(17,18,19,20) You’ve emotionally evolved and expanded as a person, wherein you feel *comfortable and natural* at the new standard. As the prominent and prolific spiritual and emotional teacher and scientist Dr. David Hawkins stated: 你承诺你想要的标准，即使是在短暂的时间里感到不舒服。通过拥抱你的情绪而不是压抑它们，你的身份会很快适应你的新标准，你会到达一个被接受的地方。 ^(17,18,19,20) 作为一个人，你在情感上已经进化和扩展，在新的标准下，你感到舒适和自然。作为杰出的和多产的精神和情感教师和科学家博士。大卫 Hawkins 说：

“The unconscious will allow us to have only what we believe we deserve. If we have a small view of ourselves, then what we deserve is poverty. And our unconscious will see to it that we have that actuality.”^(21) “潜意识将允许我们只拥有我们认为我们应得的东西。如果我们对自己有一个狭隘的看法，那么我们应得的就是贫穷。我们的潜意识会确保我们拥有这种现实。” ^(21)

To make something a new standard, you stop saying yes to the 80 percent—*your now 2x identity and standards*—that no longer fits. You embrace rejection and learning at the new standard until you reach a place of capability and confidence at the new standard. 为了使某些东西成为一个新的标准，你停止对 80%不再适合的人说“是”-你现在的 2 倍身份和标准。你接受拒绝和学习新的标准，直到你达到一个能力和信心的地方在新的标准。

For instance, if you’re a professional speaker and your current speaking fee is $25,000, raise your minimum fee to $50,000 and see what happens. Over the next few months, you may get a dozen speaking inquiries, and all of them but one reject your new fee of $50,000\. Thus, you got 1/12 at the new standard. Getting this one yes at $50,000 is *10x more valuable* to your identity and confidence than getting 12/12 yeses at the $25,000 level, even though in the short-run you’d be leaving a nice chunk of money on the table. 例如，如果你是一名专业演讲者，而你目前的演讲费是 25，000 美元，那么把你的最低费用提高到 50，000 美元，看看会发生什么。在接下来的几个月里，你可能会收到十几个演讲咨询，除了一个人之外，所有人都拒绝了你的 5 万美元新收费。因此，你得到了新标准的 1/12。在 50，000 美元的价格上获得这个是对你的身份和信心的 10 倍，比在 25，000 美元的价格上获得 12/12 的是，即使在短期内，你会留下一大笔钱在桌子上。

Over time, you’ll normalize your new standard—first emotionally within, but then externally as your reputation, positioning, and level of mastery. As you do this, you re-train the outside world to see you in a new light. Your standards are the inner-filter through which you operate, but also by which aligned people can know how to operate and collaborate with you. 随着时间的推移，你会使你的新标准正常化首先是在情感上，然后是在外在上是你的声誉、定位和掌握水平。当你这样做的时候，你重新训练外面的世界，以一个新的光来看待你。您的标准是内部过滤器，您通过它操作，但也通过它，一致的人可以知道如何操作和与您协作。

With Chad’s story and your new understanding of shedding your 2x identity by elevating your minimum standards, the remainder of this chapter will deepen your understanding of the next-level application of the 10x process, which is enhancing the quality and decreasing the quantity of everything you’re doing. 通过 Chad 的故事和你对通过提高最低标准来摆脱 2x 身份的新理解，本章的剩余部分将加深你对 10x 过程的下一个层次应用的理解，这是提高你正在做的每件事的质量和减少数量。

How you do anything is how you do everything. 你怎么做事就是你怎么做事。

**What about you? 那你呢？**

*   What are the standards you hold for yourself? 你对自己的标准是什么？
*   Were your standards chosen by you, or adopted by the norms of those outside of you? 你的标准是你自己选择的，还是被你以外的人的规范所采纳的？
*   What are your own minimum standards that you’re focused on and committed to? 你自己关注和承诺的最低标准是什么？
*   What would happen if you dramatically elevated your standards? How can you move toward your 20 percent focus and mastery? What 80 percent would have to go? 如果你大幅提高你的标准会发生什么？你如何才能达到 20%的专注和掌握？80%的人会去吗？

As you embrace the 10x process, you’ll continually be doing and focusing on less. Yet, decreasing the number of things you do will increase the quality, depth, and impact by 10x. By focusing on quality over quantity, such as Carson, Linda, and Chad did, you will experience exponential and non-linear results. 当你接受 10 倍的过程时，你将继续做并专注于更少的事情。然而，减少你所做的事情的数量将使质量、深度和影响力提高 10 倍。像卡森、琳达和 Chad 那样注重质量而不是数量，你将体验到指数和非线性的结果。

Let’s do this. 我们开始吧。

## Set Unreachable Goals and 10x the Quality of What You Do 设定无法实现的目标和 10 倍的工作质量

*“Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for ‘realistic’ goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming. It’s easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000\. It’s easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s.” “世界上 99%的人相信他们没有能力成就伟大的事情，所以他们的目标是平庸。因此，“现实”目标的竞争水平是最激烈的，矛盾的是，它们是最消耗时间和精力的。筹集 100 万美元比筹集 10 万美元容易得多。在酒吧里捡一个完美的 10 比五个 8 更容易。“*

**— TIM FERRISS^(22) - TIM FERRISS ^(22)**

Jimmy Donaldson has shed his 2x-identity again and again, never seeming to get stuck or plateaued in one place for too long. Jimmy displays a rare degree of psychological flexibility, in that nothing seems too big or too much of a stretch for him. Nothing seems out of reach. 吉米·唐纳森一次又一次地摆脱了他的 2x 身份，似乎从来没有在一个地方停留太久。吉米表现出了一种罕见的心理灵活性，因为对他来说，没有什么是太大或太大的延伸。似乎没有什么是遥不可及的。

In 2015, Jimmy was 17 years old. He was living at his mom’s house in rural North Carolina. He was a middle-class white kid with few skills who made mediocre YouTube videos in his bedroom. Even still, he had high aspirations for himself, including becoming the number one YouTuber in the world.^(23,24) 2015 年，吉米 17 岁。他住在北卡罗来纳州农村他母亲的房子里。他是一个中产阶级白色孩子，几乎没有什么技能，在卧室里制作平庸的 YouTube 视频。即便如此，他对自己的期望也很高，包括成为全球第一 YouTube 主播。 ^(23,24)

Fast-forward seven years to 2022 and Jimmy, now age 23, has nearly achieved his goal of becoming the number one YouTuber in the world. Known by his alter ego and brand, *MrBeast*, Jimmy now had hundreds of millions of subscribers across his various social media channels, he’s become the fastest-rising Internet sensation in the world, he has a team of over 150 people, and he leads or is involved in an umbrella of businesses which do nearly a billion dollars in annual revenue. 快进到 2022 年的 7 年，现年 23 岁的吉米几乎实现了他成为世界头号 YouTube 用户的目标。吉米以他的另一个自我和品牌 MrBeast 而闻名，他现在在他的各种社交媒体渠道上拥有数亿订阅者，他已经成为世界上增长最快的互联网红人，他拥有一支超过 150 人的团队，他领导或参与了一系列年收入近 10 亿美元的企业。

In March of 2022, Jimmy was interviewed on the Joe Rogan podcast. Joe asked Jimmy, “Do you have a lot of guys ask you for advice? like ‘Hey, I want to be like MrBeast.’” 2022 年 3 月，吉米接受了 Joe Rogan 播客的采访。乔问吉米：“你有很多男人向你寻求建议吗？比如'嘿，我想成为野兽先生'“

The question excited Jimmy. He asked Joe to open his Twitter feed, where he showed the 10x results of someone he’d recently mentored. 这个问题让吉米兴奋不已。他让乔打开他的 Twitter 提要，在那里他显示了他最近指导过的一个人的 10 倍结果。

“Before I started mentoring him, he was doing 4.6 million views on YouTube per month, making $24 grand. Probably seven to eight months later, we got him up to 45 million views, and he had a $400,000 month!”^(25) “在我开始指导他之前，他每月在 YouTube 上有 460 万次观看，赚了 2.4 万美元。大概七到八个月后，我们让他达到了 4500 万次观看，他的月收入达到了 40 万美元！“ ^(25)

Blown away, Joe asked, “What kind of advice did you give that makes such an exponential change?” 乔被吹走了，问：“你给予了什么样的建议，使如此指数级的变化？“

Read Jimmy’s next response *very carefully*. It clarifies how he applies the 10x process to achieve exponential results by intentionally doing less. Here’s his response: 仔细阅读吉米的下一个回答。它阐明了他如何应用 10x 过程，通过故意少做一些事情来达到指数级的结果。以下是他的回答：

“As weird as it sounds, it’s much easier getting five million views on one video than 100-thou-sand views on 50 videos. . . You could upload one great video per year and get more views than if you uploaded 100 mediocre videos. It’s very exponential. To do well on YouTube, you just need people to click your videos and watch them. . . If you get people to click your video ten percent more, and watch your video ten percent longer than mine, you don’t get ten percent more views, you get like four-times the views. You have to think exponentially. A ten percent better video gets four-times the views, not ten percent more views. Once you understand that, you funnel your energy better, and really hyper-obsess over these videos. Triple the amount of time you’re putting into that video cause you’re not going the get triple the views, you’re going to 10x the views. So [I help those I mentor] make their videos really good, and also help them build out a team, like an editor. Cause if you’re doing five jobs, then you can only put 20 percent of your time into each. If you hire an editor, that editor can put 100 percent of his time into that. You can’t spend ten hours per day editing, but he can.” “虽然听起来很奇怪，但在一个视频上获得 500 万次的浏览量要比在 50 个视频上获得 10 万次的浏览量要容易得多。. .你可以每年上传一个很棒的视频，并获得比上传 100 个平庸的视频更多的浏览量。这是非常指数化的。要想在 YouTube 上表现出色，你只需要人们点击你的视频并观看它们。. .如果你让人们点击你的视频多 10%，观看你的视频的时间比我的多 10%，你不会得到 10%的浏览量，你得到的浏览量是 4 倍。你必须以指数方式思考。一个好 10%的视频会获得四倍的浏览量，而不是 10%的浏览量。一旦你明白了这一点，你就能更好地集中精力，对这些视频非常着迷。三倍的时间，你投入到视频，因为你不会得到三倍的视图，你要 10 倍的视图。所以（我帮助那些我指导的人）制作他们的视频真的很好，也帮助他们建立一个团队，就像编辑。 因为如果你要做五份工作，那么你只能把 20%的时间放在每一份上。如果你雇了一个编辑，这个编辑可以把他 100%的时间投入到这个工作中。你不能每天花十个小时编辑，但他可以。“

Straight from the mouth of MrBeast himself. 10x is literally that simple. As Jimmy explained, you’ve got to think exponentially. You can’t think linearly if you want 10x results. To think exponentially, you must think *qualitatively*, not quantitatively. It’s not about more volume and more effort. That’s 2x-thinking, which is linear, slow, and can never produce the exponential results Jimmy is describing. 直接从 MrBeast 口中说出。10x 就是这么简单。就像吉米解释的那样，你必须以指数的方式思考。如果你想要 10 倍的结果，你不能线性思考。要想以指数方式思考，你必须定性地思考，而不是定量地思考。这不是更多的量和更多的努力。这是 2x 思维，线性的，缓慢的，永远不会产生吉米描述的指数结果。

When you begin thinking in terms of quality over quantity, you funnel your energy better. You stop burning yourself out pumping out more and more, or doing a million different jobs as a rugged individualist. 当你开始考虑质量而不是数量时，你会更好地收集你的能量。你不再把自己累得筋疲力尽，不再像一个坚强的个人主义者那样做一百万份不同的工作。

Instead, you focus on your 20 percent and get really, *really* good at what you do. You build a team around you to handle what would have been your 80 percent. However, for your team members, their role is not *their* 80 percent, since you’re hiring pros who love doing the other aspects of the work, whether that be logistics, editing, etc. 相反，你专注于你的 20%，并真正地做好你所做的事情。你在你周围建立一个团队来处理你 80%的事情。然而，对于你的团队成员来说，他们的角色不是他们的 80%，因为你雇佣的专业人士喜欢做其他工作，无论是后勤，编辑等等。

Summing up Jimmy’s insights on 10x thinking in three bullets: 用三个子弹总结吉米对 10 倍思维的见解：

*   Think *exponentially*, which means thinking both much bigger and non-linearly. 以指数方式思考，这意味着既要考虑更大的问题，也要考虑非线性问题。
*   Hyper focus on quality over quantity, and get really good at what you do. 过度关注质量而不是数量，并真正做好你所做的事情。
*   Build a team to handle everything else so you can focus on achieving quality in your craft. 建立一个团队来处理其他事情，这样你就可以专注于实现你的工艺质量。

To go 10x bigger, you focus on getting *10x better*. 要想扩大 10 倍，你必须专注于提高 10 倍。

To get 10x better, you continually elevate the vision and standards of what you do. You commit to your 20 percent, hyper focusing on quality over quantity. You let go of the 80 percent, knowing that effort alone is not what produces exponential results. 为了达到 10 倍的效果，你需要不断提升你所做的工作的愿景和标准。你承诺你的 20%，过度关注质量而不是数量。你放弃了 80%，知道光靠努力并不能产生指数级的结果。

It’s crucial to note that being able to do something well, even exceptionally well, doesn’t usually translate to the *level of quality* Jimmy is describing, which produces exponential results. 重要的是要注意，能够做好某件事，即使是非常好，通常并不能转化为 Jimmy 描述的质量水平，这会产生指数级的结果。

To reach the level of quality that produces exponential results, you need to think exponentially bigger and different. You’ve got to have a vision and standards big enough, and specific enough, that the quality you’re creating is funneled toward that. 为了达到产生指数结果的质量水平，你需要以指数的方式思考更大和不同。你必须有一个足够大、足够具体的愿景和标准，这样你所创造的质量就能朝着这个方向发展。

If your goal is small, such as 2x, then your efforts will mostly be wasted. You’re not being stretched. You may technically be getting more proficient at what you’re doing. But you’re not evolving or innovating. You’re just deepening your habitual grooves, which doesn’t mean you’re actually getting better. 如果你的目标很小，比如 2x，那么你的努力大部分都白费了。你没有被拉伸。技术上来说，你可能会变得更加熟练你正在做的事情。但你没有进化或创新。你只是加深了你的习惯，这并不意味着你真的在变好。

It’s not effort that matters, but where that effort *is directed*. 重要的不是努力，而是努力的方向。

Whatever you focus on and commit to, you become the master of. 无论你专注于什么，你都会成为你的主人。

It is for this reason that the proposed “10,000 rule” presented by pop-psychologist Malcolm Gladwell^(26) is phony baloney. “It isn’t 10,000 hours that creates outliers,” said entrepreneur and angel investor Naval Ravikant. “It’s 10,000 iterations.”^(27) 正是由于这个原因，流行心理学家马尔科姆·格拉德威尔提出的“一万条规则”是假的。“创造离群值的不是 1 万小时，”企业家兼天使投资人海军 Ravikant 说。“就是一万次迭代。” ^(27)

Yes, reps matter. *But only when those reps are directed toward a 10x upgrade.* 是的，代表很重要。但只有当这些代表被引导到 10 倍升级。

Without a 10x goal that your reps are directed to, you’ll just be repeating the same form and errors over and over. You’ll be optimizing for more of what you’ve already got, not something of an entirely new and different *quality*. 如果你的销售代表没有一个 10 倍的目标，你只会一遍又一遍地重复同样的形式和错误。你将优化更多你已经拥有的东西，而不是一个全新的和不同的质量。

Most people miss the gold coins around them because they’re focused on finding the bronze coins. They’re committed to the bronze coins. Their identity is wrapped up in the bronze coins. They’re optimizing themselves and their lives for bronze coins. 大多数人会想念身边的金币，因为他们专注于寻找铜币。他们只负责铜币。他们的身份被包裹在铜币里。他们在优化自己和他们的生活以获得铜币。

You get what you’re focused on. 你得到你所关注的。

You master at the level of your focus and standards. 你掌握的是你的重点和标准。

Does this mean reps and quantity effort don’t matter? Of course not. 这是否意味着代表和数量的努力并不重要？当然不会了。

Jimmy has made or produced literally *thousands* of YouTube videos at this point. That’s a lot of reps. The difference between Jimmy and the millions of other people who have also made hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of YouTube videos is that Jimmy’s vision and standards are impossibly bigger than anyone else’s. Indeed, he was very intent on becoming the number one YouTuber in the world, and he wasn’t private about it. To reach that standard, he needed to become uniquely brilliant at creating videos that hundreds of millions of people watched. To do that, he needed a growing team of committed people to help him. 吉米已经制作或制作了成千上万的 YouTube 视频。好多代表啊。吉米和其他数百万制作了数百、数千甚至数万 YouTube 视频的人之间的区别在于，吉米的视野和标准比任何人都要高得多。的确，他很想成为世界第一 Youtube 主播，而且他并不私下。为了达到这个标准，他需要在制作数亿人观看的视频方面变得独一无二。要做到这一点，他需要一个不断壮大的团队来帮助他。

He never got trapped in the 80 percent. 他从来没有被困在 80%。

He is laser-focused on his 20 percent, and getting better at what he does. 他专注于自己的 20%，并在他所做的事情上变得更好。

He’s always upping his game, always raising his standards for himself. 他总是在提高自己的水平，总是在提高自己的标准。

The quality of Jimmy’s videos is ultimately why we know who he is. If his videos weren’t any good, he could have millions of videos with zero views. He developed the ability to produce the quality of videos he does because he commits himself to impossibly high goals and holds himself and the work he does to impossibly high standards. 吉米的视频质量最终是我们知道他是谁的原因。如果他的视频不好，他可以有数百万个零点击量的视频。他开发了制作视频质量的能力，因为他承诺自己不可能的高目标，并把自己和他所做的工作保持在不可能的高标准。

His transformation and evolution weren’t accidental. 他的蜕变和进化，并非偶然。

They were purposeful. 他们是有目的的

As Aristotle stated, “It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present because we do not observe the agent deliberating.”^(28) The philosophical term for “purpose” is *teleology*, which means that *all* human action is driven toward or *caused by* a specific aim. The word *télos* means “the end or cause of a thing.”^(29,30) 正如亚里士多德所说：“假设目的不存在，因为我们没有观察到代理人的深思熟虑是荒谬的。”“目的”的哲学术语是目的论，这意味着所有人类行为都是朝着一个特定的目标驱动或引起的。télos 一词的意思是“一件事的目的或原因”。 ^(29,30)

Everything we do as people is driven by our goals or standards.^(31,32,33) You become whatever you’re striving for. Your goal shapes your process. Your goal also shapes your personal development and evolution. 我们作为人所做的一切都是由我们的目标或标准驱动的。##你会成为你所追求的一切。你的目标塑造了你的过程。你的目标也塑造了你的个人发展和进化。

Here’s where it gets really interesting, though, when you dissect what Jimmy is explaining, and honestly, when you simply break down the core message of this book: despite the fact that all people are driven by their goals, and that we all form a level of proficiency in whatever we focus on, the counterintuitive truth is that massive ambitions are easier than average goals. 然而，当你仔细剖析吉米所解释的内容时，老实说，当你简单地分解这本书的核心信息时，它变得非常有趣：尽管每个人都被自己的目标所驱使，而且我们对我们所关注的任何事情都形成了一定程度的熟练程度，但与直觉相反的事实是，巨大的野心比平均的目标容易。

In other words, *10x is easier than 2x.* 换句话说，10x 比 2x 更容易。

As Jimmy described, when you think exponentially, it’s no longer about the amount of effort you put in. Instead, it’s about where your effort is directed, and what your effort is directed toward. When you’re thinking 2x, you’re actually exhausting far more energy and effort than the person thinking 10x. The 10x thinker is allowing their 10x vision to guide them in radically innovative and different directions, which the 2x-thinker could never consider nor comprehend. 正如吉米所描述的，当你以指数方式思考时，它不再是你付出的努力的多少。相反，它是关于你的努力指向哪里，以及你的努力指向什么。当你思考 2 倍时，你实际上比思考 10 倍的人消耗更多的精力和精力。10 倍思考者允许他们的 10 倍视野引导他们走向根本创新和不同的方向，这是 2 倍思考者永远无法考虑和理解的。

As Dan Sullivan explained, “When 10x is your measuring stick, you immediately see how you can bypass what everyone else is doing.” 正如 Dan Sullivan 所解释的那样，“当 10x 是你的标尺时，你马上就会看到你如何绕过其他人正在做的事情。

Furthermore, the 10x thinker is solving a far more nuanced and niched problem. Rather than thinking broadly, they are thinking deeply and narrowly. They’re deep in their 20 percent and have freed themselves of the cognitive load of the 80 percent. They aren’t trying to do 100 things decently. They’re trying to do one thing at a level that’s never been seen before. 此外，10 倍思考者正在解决一个更微妙和细分的问题。他们不是广泛地思考，而是深入而狭隘地思考。他们沉浸在 20%的认知中，并将自己从 80%的认知负荷中解放出来。他们不想做 100 件体面的事。他们正试图在一个前所未有的水平上做一件事。

Taking this idea further—that focusing on exponential goals is easier than linear goals because exponential goals produce a much different and more specific form of quality—Dr. Alan Barnard, the expert on constraint theory referenced in Chapter 1, gave me the following example: if you’re trying to make $10 million, rather than solving 100 problems at $100,000 each, it’s *much easier* attempting to solve a single $30 million problem. 更进一步地把这个想法放在指数目标上比线性目标更容易，因为指数目标产生了一种非常不同和更具体的质量形式。艾伦·巴纳德（Alan Barnard）是第一章中提到的约束理论专家，他给了我下面的例子：如果你想赚 1000 万美元，而不是以每个 10 万美元的价格解决 100 个问题，你想解决一个 3000 万美元的问题要容易得多。

For multiple reasons. 有很多原因。

First, by pouring your attention into the $30 million problem, you develop learning and expertise *at that level*. The level of quality and depth to solve that single problem will be fundamentally different than the quality and depth to solve 100 cheaper and broader problems. 首先，通过把你的注意力集中在 3000 万美元的问题上，你可以在这个水平上发展学习和专业知识。解决单一问题的质量和深度水平将与解决 100 个更便宜和更广泛的问题的质量和深度有根本不同。

Another reason it’s easier focusing on quality over quantity, Dr. Barnard explains, is that by trying to solve a $30 million problem, you don’t have to be perfect. You’ve given yourself a huge margin for error that even if you only achieve one-third of the goal, you’ll reach your $10 million standard. 另一个原因是关注质量而不是数量。巴纳德解释说，通过试图解决一个 3000 万美元的问题，你不必做到完美。你已经给自己一个巨大的误差空间，即使你只实现了目标的三分之一，你也会达到 1000 万美元的标准。

It’s easier to find one person to pay you $1 million than to find 10 people who will pay $100,000\. It’s exponentially easier to find one person to pay you $1 million than to find 100 people to pay $10,000. 找一个人付你 100 万美元比找 10 个愿意付 10 万美元的人要容易得多。找一个人付你 100 万美元比找 100 个人付 1 万美元要容易得多。

In real estate, it’s easier to get one property worth $10 million than 20 properties each worth $500,000\. Once acquired, the management of the single property is infinitely easier and less time-consuming than managing the 20. 在真实的地产领域，获得一处价值 1000 万美元的房产比获得 20 处价值 50 万美元的房产更容易。一旦获得，管理单一财产比管理 20 个更容易和更少的时间。

In the 1959 classic book *The Magic of Thinking Big*, Dr. David Schwartz wrote: 在 1959 年的经典著作《大思考的魔力》中，Dr. wrote：

“A personnel selection executive told me that he receives 50 to 250 times as many applicants for jobs that pay $10,000 per year as for jobs that pay $50,000 a year. This is to say that there is at least 50 times as much competition for jobs on Second Class Street as for jobs on First Class Avenue. First Class Avenue, U.S.A., is a short, uncrowded street.”^(34) “一位人事选拔主管告诉我，他收到的申请人是年薪 1 万美元的工作的 50 到 250 倍，年薪 5 万美元的工作。也就是说，在二等街上的工作竞争至少是一等街上的工作竞争的 50 倍。美国一等大道是一条短而不拥挤的街道。” ^(34)

Although the income levels are outdated in Dr. Schwartz’s analysis, the concept remains ironclad. In all aspects of life, the competition is highest for average goals. 虽然收入水平在博士。施瓦茨的分析，这个概念仍然是铁证如山的。在生活的各个方面，平均目标的竞争最激烈。

Not only is the competition highest, but the excitement is lowest and the pathway forward is dramatically more complex and confusing with small and linear goals. 不仅是竞争最激烈，但兴奋是最低的，前进的道路显着更加复杂和混乱的小和线性目标。

With unrealistic, impossible, or “10x”-level goals, the competition is lowest, the excitement is highest, and the pathway forward becomes simple and non-linear. You stop following the crowd. You shift toward quality rather than quantity and stop competing with anyone. 有了不切实际的、不可能的或“10 倍”级别的目标，竞争最低，兴奋度最高，前进的道路变得简单和非线性。你不要跟着人群走。你转向质量而不是数量，停止与任何人竞争。

**What about you? 那你呢？**

*   Are you living exponentially or linearly? 你的生活是指数还是线性？
*   Are you focused on effort or volume, or are you creating something qualitatively different and better than anything else out there? 你是专注于努力或数量，还是你创造了一些质量上不同的东西，比其他任何东西都更好？
*   Are you spread thin, doing five or more different jobs, or do you have a growing team of people handling your former 80 percent? 你是在做五种或更多不同的工作，还是你有一个不断壮大的团队来处理你以前的 80%？

## 10x Often and Become the Best at What You Do 10x 经常，成为你所做的最好的

*“In a world that relentlessly races to the bottom, you lose if you also race to the bottom. The only way to win is to race to the top. . . . The only way to be indispensable is to be different. . . . Expertise gives you enough insight to reinvent what everyone else assumes is the truth. . . . You can train yourself to matter. . . . You are not your résumé. You are your work.” “在一个无情地追逐底部的世界里，如果你也追逐底部，你就输了。获胜的唯一方法就是冲向顶峰。. . .唯一不可或缺的方法就是与众不同。. . .专业知识给你足够的洞察力，让你重新创造别人认为的真理。. . .你可以训练自己去做事情。. . .你不是你的简历。你就是你的工作”。*

**— SETH GODIN^(35) - SETH GODIN ^(35)**

The author James Clear is an outlier at focusing on the 20 percent that will move him toward his 10x future and removing the 80 percent that got him here. 作家詹姆斯·克利尔（James Clear）是一个异类，他专注于 20%，这将使他走向 10 倍的未来，并删除了 80%让他走到这里。

By focusing on his 20 percent, which for several years was blogging, Clear was able to grow a massive email list and become a professional author—which was a major 10x jump for him. Then, after going 10x, he found a new 20 percent, which was spending nearly three years writing his book *Atomic Habits*. Once the book was written and nearing publication, he shifted his 20 percent fully to spreading and marketing the book. 通过专注于他的 20%，这几年来一直是博客，Clear 能够增长一个庞大的电子邮件列表，并成为一个专业作者，这对他来说是一个重大的 10 倍飞跃。然后，在 10 倍之后，他找到了一个新的 20%，这是他花了近三年时间写他的书《原子习惯》。当这本书写好并接近出版时，他将自己的 20%全部用于传播和营销这本书。

By flexibly shifting his 20 percent focus toward his evolving standards, like Chad and Jimmy mentioned earlier in this chapter, Clear has become a rare master of shedding his 2x-identity the moment it’s no longer serving him. He doesn’t get stuck or plateaued in any single stage or process longer than is needful. As he stated in *Atomic Habits*: 通过灵活地将他 20%的注意力转移到他不断变化的标准上，就像本章前面提到的查德和吉米一样，Clear 已经成为一个罕见的大师，在他的 2x 身份不再为他服务的那一刻摆脱了他的身份。他不会在任何一个阶段或过程中陷入停滞或停滞超过所需时间。正如他在《原子习惯》（Atomic Habits）中所说：

 “Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you think you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.”^(36) “你的行为通常是你身份的反映。你所做的是你认为自己是什么类型的人的一种指示--无论是有意识的还是无意识的。” ^(36) 

Since November of 2018 when *Atomic Habits* was published, it has sold nearly *10 million copies* at the current writing (October 2022) and has been the highest-selling nonfiction book in the world for the previous two years. To put this in proper perspective, out of the *millions of books* published each year, *less than 20* will go on to sell over *one million* copies.^(37) The average U.S. book sells less than 200 copies per year and less than 1,000 copies over its lifetime.^(38) 自 2018 年 11 月《原子习惯》出版以来，截至目前（2022 年 10 月），它已售出近 1000 万册，是过去两年世界上销量最高的非小说类书籍。从正确的角度来看，每年出版的数百万本书中，只有不到 20 本会继续销售超过 100 万册。 ^(37) 美国平均这本书每年销售不到 200 册，在其一生中销售不到 1,000 册。 ^(38)

In his blogs and book, Clear helps his readers optimize for “the beginning” of a particular objective, such as losing weight, by making the task as basic and friction-free as possible. Rather than doing 500 push-ups, do 5\. Rather than writing a chapter of your book, write one sentence. His writing and teachings are designed to help the common man make small changes that compound over time to big results. 在他的博客和书中，Clear 帮助他的读者优化特定目标的“开始”，例如减肥，通过使任务尽可能基本和无摩擦。而不是做 500 个俯卧撑，做 5 个俯卧撑。与其写一章书，不如写一句话。他的写作和教导旨在帮助普通人做出小的改变，随着时间的推移复合到大的结果。

But Clear himself is not a common man, and his results are even further from common. 但 Clear 本人并不是一个普通人，他的结果更是离普通更远。

In a world where most people’s advice is often superior to their actions, he’s one of the few people where you’re actually better-off following what he does than what he says. 在一个大多数人的建议往往上级他们的行动的世界里，他是少数几个人，你实际上更好地遵循他的行动而不是他说的。

You won’t get 10x results by doing five push-ups. 做 5 个俯卧撑不会得到 10 倍的结果。

You won’t write a blockbuster book by writing one sentence. 你写一句话是不会写出一本畅销书的。

Yes, 10x starts with five push-ups and writing one sentence, but to reach the level of focus, quality, and *mastery* needed to 10x, you must go *all-in*. You can’t see yourself as an amateur nor be satisfied with amateurish commitment and outcomes. As the quote just referenced by Clear explained, you must evolve your identity and thus your standards to a higher level or your behaviors will remain mediocre. 是的，10 x 开始时，五个俯卧撑和写一个句子，但要达到 10 x 所需的专注度，质量和掌握程度，你必须全力以赴。你不能把自己看作是一个业余爱好者，也不能满足于业余的承诺和结果。正如 Clear 刚才引用的引用所解释的那样，你必须发展你的身份，从而使你的标准达到更高的水平，否则你的行为将保持平庸。

When you actually study what James Clear *did* to produce the insane results he has, it’s obvious that he himself is a master of *optimizing for “the end”* of a particular objective, more than the beginning. He optimizes for the end of an objective by clarifying and committing 100 percent to his end goal, eliminating the 80 percent, and *refining the quality* of his work—the 20 percent. 当你真正研究詹姆斯·克利尔如何产生他所拥有的疯狂结果时，很明显，他本人是一个优化特定目标的“终点”的大师，而不是开始。他通过澄清和承诺 100%的最终目标，消除 80%的目标，并改进工作质量--20%。

More than habits, it’s his commitment to holding himself and his work to an unbelievably high standard wherein he polishes his work from 95 or more percent “done” to as close to 100 percent as he can—until it becomes exceptional. 不仅仅是习惯，这是他致力于保持自己和他的工作在一个令人难以置信的高标准，他将他的工作从 95%或更多的“完成”到接近 100%，他可以做到，直到它成为卓越。

As Clear wrote in a 2021 post: 正如 Clear 在 2021 年的一篇文章中写道：

“The difference between good and great is often an extra round of revision. The person who looks things over a second time will appear smarter or more talented, but actually is just polishing things a bit more. Take the time to get it right. Revise it one extra time.”^(39) “好和伟大之间的区别往往是一轮额外的修订。第二次看东西的人会显得更聪明或更有才华，但实际上只是在打磨东西。花点时间把它做好。再修改一遍。” ^(39)

Each time Clear reached a significant milestone, he immediately focused on raising the bar even higher for himself. Increasing the quality of his work, constantly and relentlessly, is the secret to his results. First, he continually honed the quality of his blog posts. Then, his book. Finally, he perfected the quality of his storytelling and marketing strategy for his book. 每当 Clear 达到一个重要的里程碑时，他就会立即把注意力放在提高自己的标准上。不断地、坚持不懈地提高工作质量是他取得成果的秘诀。首先，他不断提高博客文章的质量。然后，他的书。最后，他完善了他的故事讲述和营销策略的质量。

It’s helpful to review Clear’s process even further to better understand his 10x results. Luckily for us, each year for several years he published an end-of-year review describing what worked and what didn’t for him that particular year. You will see in Clear’s Annual Reviews an enhanced commitment to his 20 percent, the letting go of his 80 percent, and a consistent focus on quality over quantity. 进一步回顾 Clear 的过程有助于更好地理解他的 10 倍结果。幸运的是，他每年都会发表一份年终评论，描述那一年什么对他有用，什么对他没用。你会在 Clear 的年度评论中看到，他对 20%的承诺得到了加强，放弃了 80%的承诺，并始终如一地关注质量而不是数量。

In his *2014 Annual Review*, after a few years of successfully blogging about habits and growing a sizable email list, Clear discusses his desire to write a book (his next 10x ambition). As he stated: 在他的 2014 年年度评论中，在成功地写了几年关于习惯的博客并增加了一个相当大的电子邮件列表之后，Clear 讨论了他写一本书的愿望（他的下一个 10 倍的野心）。正如他所说：

“What am I focused on? Going pro as a writer. I’ve been a full-time entrepreneur for four years now. I’ve started four different businesses (two of which succeeded) and a number of smaller projects. . .More than anything I’ve done, I love writing my articles each week and helping people build habits that stick. So, it’s time to phase out other projects and turn pro. Mostly, that means finishing my first book. And 2015 is the year to do it.”^(40) “我专注于什么？职业作家。我做全职企业家已经四年了。我已经开始了四个不同的企业（其中两个成功了）和一些较小的项目。.我最喜欢的是每周写文章，帮助人们养成坚持的习惯。所以，现在是时候淘汰其他项目，转向专业了。这意味着完成我的第一本书。而 2015 年正是要做到这一点的一年。” ^(40)

In his *2015 Annual Review*, he stated that he got his book deal for what became *Atomic Habits.*^(41) At that point, writing the book became his number one focus (his new 20 percent). He still maintained his blog and other activities, but those were subtly becoming part of his 80 percent, which he was phasing out to focus on his next 10x jump. He also mentioned hiring his first full-time employee to manage much of his online business while he wrote the book. 在他的 2015 年年度评论中，他说他得到了他的书的合同，成为了《原子习惯》。 ^(41) 在那一刻，写书成了他的第一要务（他的新 20%）。他仍然保持着他的博客和其他活动，但这些都微妙地成为了他 80%的一部分，他正在逐步停止，专注于他的下一次 10 倍跳跃。他还提到，他在写这本书时雇佣了第一个全职员工来管理他的大部分在线业务。

In his *2016 Annual Review*, Clear describes the challenge he faced transitioning from world-class blogger to writing a world-class book: 在他的 2016 年年度回顾中，Clear 描述了他从世界级的博客作家到写一本世界级的书所面临的挑战：

“What didn’t go so well this year? Book writing. Plain and simple, 2016 was the worst year of writing of my young career. I haven’t been at this very long, but I’ve been at it long enough to know that this year was a total disaster from a writing standpoint. . . It all started at the end of 2015 when I signed a major book deal with Penguin Random House. As soon as the book became a reality, my perfectionism kicked into high gear. . . Looking back now, I realize that I spent a large part of 2016 learning how to create a new style of work. For the three years prior, I was writing a new article every Monday and Thursday. The focus was on creating great work that was usually 1,500 words or less. Now, my writing ambitions have grown and I’m working to create a remarkable book of 50,000 words or more. This transition from rapid work to deep work has been hard for me—much harder than I expected. I’m just now learning what it takes to create something of that scope and do it well.”^(42) “今年有什么不顺利的？写书。简单明了，2016 年是我年轻职业生涯中写作最糟糕的一年。我在这方面做的时间不长，但我已经做了足够长的时间，我知道从写作的角度来看，今年是一场彻底的灾难。. .这一切都始于 2015 年底，当时我与企鹅兰登书屋签署了一份重要的图书协议。当这本书成为现实时，我的完美主义就进入了高潮。. .现在回想起来，我意识到 2016 年我花了很大一部分时间学习如何创建新的工作作风。在过去的三年里，我每周一和周四都会写一篇新文章。重点是创造通常 1,500 字或更少的伟大作品。现在，我的写作抱负已经增长，我正在努力创作一本 5 万字或更多的非凡的书。从快速工作到深度工作的转变对我来说很艰难--比我预期的要艰难得多。我现在正在学习如何创建这样的范围的东西，并做好它。“ ^(42)

Each time you go 10x, the quality and magnitude of what you’re doing gets higher. Rather than making fast food, you’ve shifted to fine dining, which requires a much higher degree of mastery and focus. You can’t continue juggling as much. You need more time to connect bigger dots. 每增加 10 倍，你所做的事情的质量和规模就会变得更高。你不再做快餐，而是转向了精致的餐饮，这需要更高程度的掌握和专注。你不能再这么玩了。你需要更多的时间来连接更大的点。

Inevitably, going 10x requires becoming a leader and hiring Whos to support the 80 percent. 10x requires you to become uniquely masterful in a narrowing 20 percent wherein you produce something innovative, valuable, and of rare quality. 不可避免的是，要达到 10 倍，就需要成为一名领导者，并聘请 Who 来支持 80%的人。10x 要求你在缩小 20%的范围内变得独一无二，在这个范围内，你生产出创新的、有价值的、稀有的品质。

People make the leap of hiring far too late. By hiring even a personal or digital assistant, as Clear did, you can immediately free up space for your 20 percent, which work is higher value and higher leverage than the 80 percent busy tasks. The longer you wait to get a Who, the slower your progress will be because you’ll be mired in the 80 percent. This not only keeps you split focused, but slows your mastery of the 20 percent. 人们开始招聘已经太晚了。通过雇用一个个人或数字助理，就像 Clear 所做的那样，你可以立即为你的 20%腾出空间，这些工作比 80%忙碌任务更有价值和更大的杠杆作用。你等待的时间越长，你的进展就会越慢，因为你会陷入 80%的困境。这不仅会让你分散注意力，还会减缓你对 20%的掌握。

In his *2017 Annual Review*, Clear describes lasering almost all of his energy and effort into writing *Atomic Habits* while his business ran almost entirely without him: 在他的 2017 年年度评论中，Clear 描述了他几乎所有的精力和精力都投入到撰写原子习惯上，而他的业务几乎完全没有他的情况下运行：

“What went well this year? Okay, here’s where I succeeded this year. Book writing. I wrote a book! (Well, mostly.) Naturally, completing the manuscript became my primary area of focus for 2017\. I finished the first draft of the manuscript in November, and we’re working on edits now. There are still many improvements to make and, truthfully, a few months of work left, but it feels really good to see literally years of work all coming together… Systems building. Because I spent nearly all of my time writing the book, I had virtually no time to work on the other aspects of my business, which, you can imagine, also happen to be fairly important. Thankfully, my business still had a great year because, with the help of my assistant Lyndsey, we have built a variety of systems that enable the business to run without constant attention from me.”^(43) “今年怎么样？好吧，这是我今年成功的地方。写书。我写了本书！(Well 大多数。）自然，完成手稿成为我 2017 年的主要关注领域。我在 11 月完成了手稿的初稿，我们现在正在编辑。还有很多改进要做，说实话，还有几个月的工作要做，但看到多年的工作都走到一起，感觉真的很好...系统建设。因为我几乎把所有的时间都花在写这本书上，所以我几乎没有时间去做我生意的其他方面，你可以想象，这也是相当重要的。值得庆幸的是，我的业务今年仍然很棒，因为在我的助理 Lyndsey 的帮助下，我们建立了各种系统，使业务能够在没有我的持续关注的情况下运行。 ^(43)

10x requires letting go of increasing distractions. 10 x 需要释放越来越多的干扰。

Every time you go 10x, you become more focused and less broad. 每增加 10 倍，你就会变得更加专注，不再那么宽泛。

You have higher ambitions with greater and deeper scope, requiring more and better of your attention. To make something 10x better involves deep, *deep* work. Innovation occurs as you break everything down and put it back together in a simpler, easier, and *better* form. 你拥有更高的野心，拥有更大和更深刻的范围，需要你更多和更好的关注。要使事情变得更好 10 倍，需要深入的工作。创新发生在你分解所有东西，并以更简单、更容易、更好的形式重新组合在一起。

This is what James Clear spent three years doing. He was solving a highly complex problem teaching a model of habits that was compelling, useful, and accurate. He was striving to provide an innovative solution to habits—a universal human challenge he felt to be incredibly important—in a far superior manner than anything currently on the market. 这就是詹姆斯·克利尔花了三年时间做的事情。他正在解决一个高度复杂的问题，教授一个引人注目的、有用的、准确的习惯模型。他正努力提供一种创新的解决习惯的方法，他认为这是一个普遍的人类挑战，他认为是极其重要的，以一种远远上级目前市场上任何东西的方式。

He succeeded. 他成功了。

Innovation happens by *focusing on the 20 percent* that’s most relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve. 创新是通过专注于与你试图解决的问题最相关的 20%来实现的。

You can’t be involved in the great many tasks or decisions you were previously involved in. Your focus must be on higher quality and less quantity. This is why applying Who Not How is essential, wherein you simply enable capable and committed people, like Clear’s full-time assistant, to handle everything else in your life and business. 你不能参与你以前参与的许多任务或决策。你的注意力必须放在更高质量和更少数量上。这就是为什么应用 Who Not How 是必不可少的，其中你只需让有能力和忠诚的人，如 Clear 的全职助理，来处理你生活和业务中的其他一切。

In Chapter 6 of this book, you’ll learn the four-stage model every entrepreneur must go through if they want ongoing 10x jumps in their life and business. The third and final stage of this is creating what Dan Sullivan calls a Self-Managing Company, wherein the day-to-day operations and even management of the business is done by someone other than the entrepreneur. 在本书的第六章中，你将学习到每个企业家如果想在生活和业务中持续 10 倍的飞跃，必须经历的四阶段模型。第三个也是最后一个阶段是创建丹·沙利文所说的自我管理公司，在这种公司中，日常运营甚至管理都由企业家以外的人来完成。

Although Clear only had one full-time employee while writing *Atomic Habits*, he was still applying the principle of the Self-Managing Company. As he stated, his assistant managed nearly all the affairs of his day-to-day business while he wrote his book. 虽然在写《原子习惯》的时候，克利尔只有一个全职员工，但他还是运用了自我管理公司的原则。正如他所说，他的助手在他写书时几乎处理了他日常事务的所有事务。

Importantly, your team actually relies on you enabling them to be self-managing, for at least two crucial reasons. First, for your team to operate both at its best and for the individual members to thrive, research shows that autonomy and a sense of ownership are essential (i.e., *self-determination theory*).^(44,45) Without feeling and having autonomy and ownership in what they’re doing, your team will be handicapped in their own growth and motivation. 重要的是，你的团队实际上依赖于你，使他们能够自我管理，至少有两个关键原因。首先，为了让你的团队以最佳状态运作，并让每个成员茁壮成长，研究表明，自主权和主人翁感是至关重要的（即，自我决定理论）。 ^(44,45) 如果对他们所做的事情没有感觉、没有自主权和所有权，你的团队将在他们自己的成长和动力上受到阻碍。

Second, your team relies on you enabling them to be self-managing so that you, as the entrepreneur and visionary, can spend most of your time in your 20 percent genius zone. It’s essential and crucial for the ongoing success of your business and team that you continually evolve and innovate what you’re doing—for you to become *10x better and more valuable* in what you offer. This can’t happen if you’re overly involved in the 80 percent, either micromanaging or just simply doing it all on your own. Staying in the 80 percent is how you get caught in the mire of mediocrity and quickly race to the bottom of quality and uniqueness. It’s how you stay 2x. 其次，你的团队依赖于你，让他们能够自我管理，这样你作为一个企业家和有远见的人，就可以把大部分时间花在你的 20%天才区。对于您的业务和团队的持续成功至关重要，您必须不断地发展和创新您正在做的事情-使您在所提供的服务中变得更好和更有价值。如果你过度参与 80%的工作，要么是微观管理，要么只是简单地自己做这一切，这就不会发生。停留在 80%是你如何陷入平庸的泥潭，并快速地跑到质量和独特性的底部。这就是你如何保持 2x。

In his *2018 Annual Review*, Clear discusses the publication and initial success of his book: 在他的 2018 年度回顾中，Clear 讨论了他的书的出版和初步成功：

“What went well this year? *Atomic Habits*. I feel like I’ve told everyone within earshot at this point, but in case you haven’t heard: I published a book this year! . . . I was still working on the manuscript in January and February of this year. If you had tapped me on the shoulder in the middle of my frantic final edits and told me the book would become a bestseller before the year ended, I almost certainly would have cried with relief. As 2018 draws to a close, *Atomic Habits* has been out for 11 weeks (published on October 16, 2018). I did every single thing I could to make this book a success (starting with spending 3 years writing the best book possible), but the reception has outpaced even my high hopes.”^(46) “今年怎么样？原子习惯我觉得我已经告诉了所有人在这一点上听得到，但如果你还没有听说：今年我出了一本书！. . .今年 1 月和 2 月，我还在写手稿。如果你在我疯狂的最后编辑的时候拍了拍我的肩膀，告诉我这本书会在年底前成为畅销书，我几乎肯定会如释重负地哭出来。随着 2018 年接近尾声，《原子习惯》已经出版了 11 周（2018 年 10 月 16 日出版）。我尽了我所能使这本书获得成功（从花了 3 年时间写尽可能好的书开始），但收到的速度甚至超过了我的厚望。” ^(46)

With his book now published, Clear’s 20 percent shifted to spreading the message as far as he possibly could. He upped his 10x standard and identity again. As he stated in his *2019 Annual Review*: 随着他的书现在出版，克利尔的 20%转移到尽可能广泛地传播信息。他的标准和身份再次提升了十倍。正如他在 2019 年年度回顾中所说：

“What went well this year? Book sales. *Atomic Habits* launched in October 2018, which meant that 2019 was the first full calendar year it had been available. I came in with big aspirations, but I think it’s fair to say that book sales have outpaced my expectations. As of December 2019: Over 1.3 million copies sold worldwide; 12 consecutive months on the *New York Times* bestseller list . . . Speaking. I delivered 31 paid keynote speeches in 2019\. This is far and away the most I’ve ever given in a calendar year. Obviously, this is tied directly to the success of *Atomic Habits*.”^(47) “今年怎么样？图书销售。Atomic Habits 于 2018 年 10 月推出，这意味着 2019 年是它推出的第一个完整日历年。我带着远大的抱负来到这里，但我认为可以公平地说，图书销售已经超出了我的预期。截至 2019 年 12 月：全球销量超过 130 万册;连续 12 个月登上纽约时报畅销书排行榜。. .请讲我在 2019 年发表了 31 次付费主题演讲。这是我在一个日历年里付出的最多的一次。显然，这与原子习惯的成功直接相关。 ^(47)

10x is about quality, not quantity. 10 x 是关于质量，而不是数量。

James Clear understood this, and now he has the most successful non-fiction book in the world. 詹姆斯·克利尔明白这一点，现在他拥有了世界上最成功的非小说类书籍。

10x is committing to your ambitious vision and making that vision your standard. You do this by locking into the 20 percent that will get you there and letting go of the 80 percent that got you here. 10 x 致力于您雄心勃勃的愿景，并使其成为您的标准。你要做到这一点，就是锁定 20%，让 80%让你走到这一步。

The completion of each 10x process requires the comprehensive transformation of yourself and your entire life. The whole system and model of who you are and even your very business look unrecognizably different at 10x. The initial 80 percent becomes literally non-existent. The initial 20 percent becomes your new 100 percent—it’s now your normal life, identity, and reality. 每一个 10 x 过程的完成都需要你自己和你整个人生的全面转变。整个系统和模型，你是谁，甚至你的业务看起来是无法辨认的不同 10 倍。最初的 80%变成了字面上不存在。最初的 20%变成了你新的 100%现在是你正常的生活、身份和现实。

Just as Jimmy Donaldson (MrBeast) described in making successful YouTube videos, getting 10x or 100x bigger results doesn’t mean your video—or whatever you’re creating—needs to be 10x better than everything else out there. Rather, Jimmy said your video or product only needs be *10 or 20 percent better* and, importantly*, different,* to get 4-10x the results of even the “best stuff.” 正如 Jimmy 唐纳森（MrBeast）在制作成功的 YouTube 视频时所描述的那样，获得 10 倍或 100 倍的结果并不意味着你的视频-或你正在创作的任何东西-需要比其他东西好 10 倍。相反，吉米说，你的视频或产品只需要提高 10%或 20%，重要的是，不同，即使是“最好的东西”，效果也是 4- 10 倍。

Being both *better* and *different* is essential and points directly to the fact that 10x is fundamentally qualitative, not quantitative. 10x means an evolution has occurred, and what you’re now doing is actually incomparable to what others are doing, or what you were previously doing. 更好和与众不同是至关重要的，这直接表明 10 倍基本上是定性的，而不是定量的。10 倍意味着进化已经发生，你现在所做的事情实际上与其他人所做的事情，或者你以前所做的事情是不可比拟的。

Because 10x is qualitative and transformational, it’s also non-competitive. It’s not about you doing or being better than anyone else. Rather, you’re being increasingly unique and different from what everyone else is doing. Your work is innovative and distinct from what the masses of 2x’ers are up to. 因为 10x 是定性和转型的，它也是非竞争性的。这不是你比别人做得好或比别人好。相反，你越来越独特，与其他人正在做的事情不同。你的工作是创新的，不同于大众的 2x'ers 是什么。

10x quality and transformation is how you race to the top. 10 倍的质量和转型是你如何竞争到顶部。

2x quantity and competition is how you race to the bottom. 2 倍的数量和竞争是你如何比赛到底部。

*Atomic Habits* isn’t 10x better than other similar self-help books, but it is 10-20 percent better and different than the best self-help books. It’s a clear qualitative improvement. Consequently, it gets 10x or 100x the results of even the outliers. 《原子习惯》并不比其他类似的自助书籍好 10 倍，但它比最好的自助书籍好 10%到 20%，也不一样。这是一个明显的质的改进。因此，它得到的结果是离群值的 10 倍或 100 倍。

Despite not being 10x better than the competition, it is safe and important to say that Chad Willardson, Jimmy Donaldson, and James Clear are all *10x better* than their former selves. They aren’t playing a 2x-game of continuing what they’d done before. They aren’t competing with anyone else. Instead, they’re choosing their own standards for themselves, committing to their 20 percent, and building a team around them to manage the rest. 尽管没有比竞争对手好 10 倍，但可以安全地说，查德·威拉德森、吉米·唐纳森和詹姆斯·克利尔都比他们以前的自己好 10 倍。他们不是在玩一个继续他们以前做过的事情的 2x 游戏。他们不与任何人竞争。相反，他们为自己选择了自己的标准，承诺自己的 20%，并围绕他们建立一个团队来管理其余的。

When you focus on quality over quantity—as Chad, Jimmy, and Clear have done—you can become the best in the world at what you do. By becoming the best at what you do, you get radically outsized returns on the investment of your time and energy. 当你专注于质量而不是数量时--就像 Chad、Jimmy 和 Clear 所做的那样--你可以成为世界上最好的你所做的事情。通过成为你所做的最好的人，你的时间和精力的投资获得了巨大的回报。

In the book *The Dip*, Seth Godin explains the importance and benefits of becoming the best in the world at what you do. As Godin explains in *The Dip*: 在《浸》一书中，赛斯·戈丁解释了在你所做的事情上成为世界上最好的重要性和好处。正如 Godin 在 The Dip 中解释的那样：

“The rewards are heavily skewed, so much so that it’s typical for #1 to get ten times the benefit of #10, and a hundred times the benefit of #100.”^(48) “奖励严重倾斜，以至于通常#1 获得 10 倍的收益，100 倍的收益。 ^(48)

In order to become the best, you must embrace the art of *quitting*. Those who become the best don’t hold on to any 80 percent activity or identity for too long. 为了成为最好的人，你必须拥抱放弃的艺术。那些成为最好的人不会保持任何 80%的活动或身份太久。

Godin explains that quitting the wrong stuff takes huge guts. It’s scary letting go of the 80 percent because the 80 percent is your comfort zone. It’s your security blanket. It’s what you’ve already mastered and can basically do on autopilot. It’s your paycheck. It’s your identity and how you’re known. It’s your story and your habits. 戈丁解释说，放弃错误的东西需要巨大的勇气。放弃 80%是可怕的，因为 80%是你的舒适区。这是你的安全毯这是你已经掌握的，基本上可以在自动驾驶仪上做的。这是你的薪水。这是你的身份和你的为人所知。这是你的故事和习惯。

The longer you hold on to the 80 percent out of fear, the slower your 10x transformation will occur. 你在恐惧中坚持 80%的时间越长，你的 10 倍转变就会越慢。

The faster you let go of the 80 percent out of commitment and courage, the faster your 10x transformation will occur. 你越快地放弃 80%的承诺和勇气，你的 10 倍转变就会越快。

Every great leader must face the dilemma of quitting the wrong stuff—even the stuff that’s been your bread and butter for years or decades—to become the best at what you do and realize 10x results. 每一个伟大的领导者都必须面对这样的困境：放弃错误的东西，即使是那些多年或几十年来一直是你赖以生存的东西，成为你所做的最好的人，并实现 10 倍的结果。

For instance, in the classic book *Good to Great*, Jim Collins describes what he calls *Level 5 Leaders*. These are people so committed to the cause they care about that they courageously yet happily let go of aspects of their business which are good, but not great.^(49) An example Collins uses is Darwin Smith, who was the CEO from 1971 to 1991 of Kimberly-Clark Corporation, a multinational company that produces paper-based consumer goods like toilet paper and Kleenex. 例如，在经典著作《从优秀到卓越》（Good to Great）中，吉姆·柯林斯（Jim Collins）描述了他所谓的 5 级领导者（Level 5 Leaders）。这些人是如此致力于他们关心的事业，他们勇敢而愉快地放弃了他们的业务中好的方面，但不是伟大的方面。 ^(49) 柯林斯举的一个例子是达尔文·史密斯（Darwin Smith），他在 1971 年至 1991 年期间担任金佰利公司（Kimberly-Clark Corporation）的首席执行官，该公司是一家生产卫生纸和面巾纸等纸质消费品的跨国公司。

When Smith became the CEO, he saw a huge problem for the ultimate success of Kimberly-Clark. The vast majority of revenue came from the traditional coated-paper mills. These produced paper for magazines and writing pads and had been the core business of the company for over 100 years. But Smith and his leadership team had conviction that the best path to greatness for Kimberly-Clark lay in the consumer business, where the company had demonstrated a best-in-the-world capability in its building of the Kleenex brand. 当史密斯成为首席执行官时，他看到了金伯利-克拉克最终成功的巨大问题。绝大部分收入来自传统的涂布纸米尔斯。这些公司生产用于杂志和书写垫的纸张，并一直是公司的核心业务超过 100 年。但史密斯和他的领导团队坚信，金佰利走向伟大的最佳途径在于消费者业务，该公司在打造 Kleenex 品牌方面展示了世界上最好的能力。

They believed this was the crucial 20 percent, and that the paper mills, which had been Kimberly-Clark’s bread and butter for over 100 years, was now the 80 percent. 他们认为这是至关重要的 20%，而造纸米尔斯，这 100 多年来一直是金伯利-克拉克赖以生存的面包和黄油，现在是 80%。

You can’t be great if you’re content being good. 如果你满足于做好人，你就不可能成为伟大的人。

You can be good maintaining the 80 percent, but in order to become great, you must go all-in on the 20 percent and commit to greatness. As Collins wrote: 你可以很好地保持 80%，但为了变得伟大，你必须全力以赴地做 20%，并致力于伟大。正如柯林斯所写：

“If Kimberly-Clark remained principally a paper-mill business, it would retain a secure position as a good company. But its only shot at becoming a great company was to become the best paper-based consumer company—if it could take on such companies as Procter & Gamble and Scott Paper Co. and beat them. That meant it would have to ‘stop doing’ paper mills. So, in what one director called ‘the gutsiest decision I’ve ever seen a CEO make,’ Darwin Smith sold the mills. He even sold the mill in Kimberly, Wisconsin. Then he threw all the money into a war chest for an epic battle with Procter & Gamble and Scott Paper. Wall Street analysts derided the move, and the business press called it stupid. But Smith did not waver. Twenty-five years later, Kimberly-Clark emerged from the fray as the number-one paper-based consumer-products company in the world, beating P&G in six of eight categories and owning its former archrival Scott Paper outright. For the shareholder, Kimberly-Clark under Darwin Smith beat the market by four times, easily outperforming such great companies as Coca-Cola, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, and 3M.” “如果金佰利仍然主要是一家造纸企业，它将保持作为一家好公司的稳固地位。但它要想成为一家伟大的公司，唯一的机会就是成为最好的纸类消费品公司--如果它能与宝洁和斯科特纸业公司（Scott Paper Co.）竞争的话打败他们这意味着它将不得不“停止”造纸米尔斯。因此，达尔文·史密斯（Darwin Smith）卖掉了米尔斯，这是一位董事称之为“我见过的首席执行官做出的最大胆的决定”。他甚至卖掉了威斯康星州金伯利的磨坊。然后，他把所有的钱都投进了一个战争基金，准备与宝洁公司和斯科特纸业公司进行一场史诗般的战斗。华尔街分析师嘲笑此举，商业媒体称其愚蠢。但史密斯没有动摇。25 年后，金佰利公司从竞争中脱颖而出，成为世界上最大的纸类消费品公司，在八个类别中有六个击败了宝洁，并彻底拥有了它的前主要竞争对手斯科特纸业。 对于股东来说，达尔文·史密斯领导下的金佰利公司以 4 倍的优势击败了市场，轻松超越了可口可乐、通用电气、惠普和 3M 等大公司。“

The rewards for higher and unique quality aren’t linear, but exponential. 对更高和独特质量的回报不是线性的，而是指数级的。

10x is easier than 2x. 10x 比 2x 更容易。

10x is qualitative and takes you down a totally non-linear pathway of mastery and freedom. 10x 是定性的，它带你走上一条完全非线性的掌握和自由的道路。

To go 10x requires committing fully to the 20 percent you most resonate with and eliminate everything that can’t or won’t go 10x with you. 要达到 10 倍，就需要完全投入到你最有共鸣的 20%，并消除所有不能或不愿与你达到 10 倍的东西。

You quit *everything* that can’t go 10x *from here*, even if that means eliminating the best of what got you here. 你放弃了所有不能从这里走 10 倍的东西，即使这意味着消除了让你来到这里的最好的东西。

## Chapter Takeaways 第四章要点

*   Going 10x involves the continuous process of increasing the quality and decreasing the quantity of everything you do. 达到 10 倍涉及到不断提高质量和减少你所做的每件事的数量的过程。
*   How you do anything is how you do everything. 你怎么做事就是你怎么做事。
*   Shedding your 2x-identity can be difficult, because as people we have the tendency to avoid loss, overvalue what we currently own, and desire to be seen as consistent. 摆脱你的 2x 身份可能很困难，因为作为人，我们有避免损失的倾向，高估我们目前拥有的东西，并希望被视为一致。
*   Your identity is the story you believe about yourself and the standards you hold for yourself. 你的身份是你相信的关于你自己的故事和你为自己所持的标准。
*   Defining and choosing your own minimum standards, no matter how seemingly impossible to yourself and others, is fundamental to experiencing a 10x transformation. 定义和选择你自己的最低标准，无论对你自己和他人来说是多么不可能的，这是经历 10 倍转变的基础。
*   Evolving yourself to the level of a higher minimum standard requires commitment and courage, which eventually leads to the development of new capabilities and confidence (Dan’s 4C’s formula). 将自己发展到一个更高的最低标准的水平需要承诺和勇气，这最终导致发展新的能力和信心（丹的 4C 公式）。
*   Jimmy Donaldson’s three ingredients to his 10x process are: 1) thinking exponentially and non-linearly bigger, 2) hyper-focusing on quality over quantity, and 3) building a team to handle the 80 percent so you can focus and improve in your craft. Jimmy 唐纳森的 10 倍工艺的三个要素是：1）以指数和非线性的方式思考更大，2）过度关注质量而不是数量，3）建立一个团队来处理 80%的问题，这样你就可以专注和改进你的工艺。
*   10x goals are easier than 2x goals for many reasons. 10x goals are less competitive. 10x goals require you to focus on very few things rather than many, which improves your brain’s ability to focus—research shows that continual task switching makes flow and high performance basically impossible.^(50,51) 10x goals promote non-linear approaches which produce novel, innovative, and competition-free solutions. Finally, 10x goals foster leadership and teamwork, wherein you stop doing everything yourself, managing others, or needing to be right. 10 x 目标比 2x 目标更容易，原因有很多。10 x 目标竞争力较低。10 倍的目标需要你专注于很少的事情而不是很多事情，这提高了你的大脑专注能力研究表明，持续的任务切换使得流动和高绩效基本上不可能。 ^(50,51) 10x 目标促进非线性方法，产生新颖，创新和无竞争的解决方案。最后，10 倍的目标培养领导力和团队合作，在这个过程中，你不再需要自己做任何事情，不再需要管理他人，也不再需要做正确的事情。
*   Creating 10x results doesn’t require you to be 10x better than everyone else. Even being 10–20 percent *better* (and *different*) from everything else can produce 10x bigger results than even the outliers of a particular niche or field. 创造 10 倍的结果并不要求你比其他人好 10 倍。即使是比其他任何东西好 10- 20%（和不同），也可以产生比特定利基或领域的离群值大 10 倍的结果。
