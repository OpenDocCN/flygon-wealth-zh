*“The world is divided into two types of people: those who are ‘needers’ and those who are ‘wanters.’ Needers compete for scarce resources and opportunities, while wanters are involved in the continual expansion of cooperation among abundance-minded individuals.” “世界分为两类人：他们是“需要者”和“需要者”。有需要的人争夺稀缺的资源和机会，而有需要的人则参与到富有思想的人之间不断扩大合作的过程中。*

**— DAN SULLIVAN^(1) - DAN SULIVAN ^(1)**

On August 15, 1978, when Dan Sullivan was 34 years old, he got divorced and went bankrupt *all on the same day.* 1978 年 8 月 15 日，丹·沙利文 34 岁时，他离婚并在同一天破产。

This was an insanely low and sobering moment for him. The extreme pain of his divorce and bankruptcy helped him realize that he wasn’t taking 100 percent responsibility for his life. 这对他来说是一个疯狂的低落和清醒的时刻。离婚和破产带来的极度痛苦让他意识到自己并没有对自己的生活承担 100%的责任。

Crucially, Dan realized that he hadn’t been embracing or fully owning what he truly wanted. Instead, he’d been opting more for the 80 percent of his life, which he felt he *needed* due to scarcity and loss aversion—including a bad marriage, a busy schedule, low- or no-paying clients, etc. 至关重要的是，丹意识到他没有拥抱或完全拥有他真正想要的东西。相反，他选择了更多的生活，因为稀缺和避免损失，他觉得自己需要的 80%的生活，包括糟糕的婚姻，忙碌的日程，低收入或没有收入的客户，等等。

Near the end of that year—1978—he decided that every day moving forward, he would write in his journal *exactly what he wanted*. He wanted to train himself to live life based on wants not needs, freedom not security, and abundance not scarcity. 1978 年年底时，他决定每天都要在日记里写下他想要的东西。他想训练自己，让自己过上基于需求而不是需求、自由而不是安全、富足而不是匮乏的生活。

On New Year’s Eve 2003—25 years later—Dan went to dinner with two close friends and his new wife, Babs. Side note, Babs was one of the things Dan wrote in his journal that he *really* wanted. He told his friends at that dinner: 2003 年新年前夜--25 年后--丹和两个亲密的朋友和他的新婚妻子巴布斯去吃晚饭。旁注，巴布斯是丹在日记中写的他真正想要的东西之一。他在晚宴上对朋友说：

“Today I’ve reached a milestone. I’ve completed a project. Every day, except for 12 (out of 9,131), during the last 25 years, I’ve done this exercise of writing down what I want. Twenty-five years later, I can tell you I’m a really powerful wanter.” “今天我达到了一个里程碑。我完成了一个项目。在过去的 25 年里，除了 12 天（9,131 天中的 12 天），我每天都在做这样的练习，写下我想要的东西。二十五年后，我可以告诉你，我是一个非常强大的渴望者。

Dan learned to stop justifying what he wanted. He stopped being constrained by needs or rationalizations. He stopped worrying of others’ opinions about his goals. 丹学会了不再为自己想要的东西辩护。他不再被需求或合理化所束缚。他不再担心别人对他目标的看法。

Instead of chasing what he thought he needed or what others thought he needed, Dan went 10x over and over—from getting his new business off the ground coaching entrepreneurs one-on-one to now having a global company training tens of thousands of entrepreneurs—by embracing only that which he sincerely wanted. 丹没有去追求他认为自己需要的东西，也没有去追求别人认为他需要的东西，而是一次又一次地去做 10 倍的工作--从一对一的指导创业者，到现在有一家全球性的公司来培训成千上万的创业者--只接受他真心想要的东西。

Wanting and needing are two completely different things. 想要和需要是完全不同的两件事。

Entrepreneurs who operate out of need won’t accomplish 10x goals because no one *needs* to reach them. You can survive just fine living a 2x lifestyle. Rather, 10x achievements are highly personal—they are goals you intrinsically want to reach. 出于需要而经营的企业家不会完成 10 倍的目标，因为没有人需要达到这些目标。你可以活得很好，过着 2x 的生活方式。更确切地说，10 倍的成就是高度个人化的--它们是你内在想要达到的目标。

In this chapter, you’re going to learn how to let go of scarcity and competition-based needing and replace it with abundance and creativity-based wanting. 在这一章中，你将学习如何放弃稀缺和基于竞争的需求，用丰富和基于创造的需求取而代之。

By becoming comfortable and unapologetic about wanting what you want—which is a skill you continually enhance—you also learn how to identify and develop what Dan calls your Unique Ability. When you embrace your Unique Ability, you stop worrying about what other people are doing. You stop competing entirely. But also, you realize in the realest sense who you truly are. You carve away everything that’s not “The David” and transform yourself into your most powerful, valuable, and genuine self-expression. 通过对你想要的东西变得舒适和不道歉--这是一种你不断加强的技能--你也学会了如何识别和发展丹所谓的你的独特能力。当你拥抱你的独特能力时，你就不再担心别人在做什么。你完全停止竞争。但同时，你也会真正意识到你是谁。你把所有不是“大卫”的东西都刻出来，把自己变成最强大、最有价值、最真实的自我表达。

Let’s begin. 我们开始吧.

## Escape the Scarcity of Needing and Embrace the Abundance of Wanting 逃离需要的匮乏拥抱渴望的富足

A crucial aspect of “wanting what you want” is that you absolutely do not need to justify your desires to anyone. “想要你想要的”的一个重要方面是，你绝对不需要向任何人证明你的欲望。

There is no justification of wants. If someone asks why you want something, you don’t need to explain yourself. 想要是没有理由的。如果有人问你为什么想要某样东西，你不需要解释自己。

You simply want it because you want it. 你只是想要它，因为你想要它。

That’s why. 这就是原因。

Having a purely wanting approach to life is unthinkable and even incomprehensible for most people because culture and society program people—in school and as employees—to chase a certain set of needs, especially money, as an end in itself. The things we seek are seen as limited and scarce resources which we shouldn’t want an abundance of, because if we got more than we “should,” then someone else would be left without. 对大多数人来说，一种纯粹想要的生活方式是不可想象的，甚至是不可理解的，因为文化和社会计划的人们无论是在学校还是在雇员，追求某种特定的需求，尤其是金钱，本身就是目的。我们寻求的东西被视为有限而稀缺的资源，我们不应该想要大量的资源，因为如果我们得到的东西超过了我们“应该”的，那么其他人就会没有了。

As Dan further said in his book *Wanting What You Want:* 正如丹在他的书中所说的：

“When you’re in the world of needing, you always have to justify what you need because the needing world is one of scarcity. If you need something scarce, you have to rationalize why you should have it rather than someone else. Not only do you have to justify what you need to yourself, but you have to justify it to everyone else as well. Someone who is a lifetime needer spends a great deal of daily thinking and communication in a never-ending process of justification. But if you cross the line and go into the world of wanting, there’s no justification. Ever. . . There’s a stand entrepreneurs have to take to not give in to their previous need to justify. Some courage is required here. You have to be committed to living in a world of wanting and not falling back into a life of needing. When somebody asks you, ‘Why do you need that?’ (because they’ll say need rather than want), there’s a temptation to slip back into previous language and begin to justify. You mustn’t give in to that. Say, ‘First of all, I don’t need it; I want it.’ And then, ‘The reason I want it is because I want it.’ This is not easily understood by everyone because, for most people, everything in their needing world has to have a justifying reason. When you’re dealing with scarcity, you probably are taking someone else’s scarce resource. But in the world of wanting, there’s no scarcity, because it’s a world of innovation—not of taking. Wanters are creating things that didn’t exist before. You’re creating something new that in no way requires taking something from someone else.”^(2) “当你处于需要的世界时，你总是必须证明你需要的东西是合理的，因为需要的世界是稀缺的。如果你需要一些稀缺的东西，你必须合理地解释为什么你应该拥有它而不是别人。你不仅要向自己证明你所需要的东西，还要向其他人证明它。一个需要一生的人，每天花大量的思考和沟通，在一个永无止境的辩护过程中。但如果你越过了界限，进入了欲望的世界，那就没有理由了。永远不会. .企业家必须采取一种立场，不要给予于他们以前的证明。这里需要一些勇气。你必须致力于生活在一个渴望的世界中，而不是回到一个需要的生活中。当有人问你，'你为什么需要它？'（因为他们会说需要而不是想要），有一种诱惑，滑回到以前的语言，开始辩解。你不能给予于这个。 你说：‘首先，我不需要它;我想要。”然后，“我想要它的原因是因为我想要它。这并不容易被每个人理解，因为对大多数人来说，他们需要的世界中的每件事都必须有一个合理的理由。当你在处理稀缺性时，你很可能是在拿走别人的稀缺资源。但在缺乏的世界里，没有稀缺，因为这是一个创新的世界，而不是索取。流浪者创造了以前不存在的东西。你正在创造新的东西，而不需要从别人那里拿走东西。“第 0#个

There are two critically important points Dan is making about wanting, which most people don’t grasp. Because they don’t grasp these two points, people opt for a life of needing, wherein they compete for scarce resources which they must justify seeking. Here are Dan’s two core points: 丹提出了两个关于欲望的关键要点，这是大多数人都不理解的。因为他们没有把握这两点，人们选择了一种需要的生活，在这种生活中，他们争夺稀缺的资源，他们必须证明他们的追求是合理的。以下是丹的两个核心观点：

1.  Wanting is about abundance and creation. Creativity is not a scarce resource and takes nothing away from anyone else. Rather, creativity actually creates new resources and opportunities which previously didn’t exist and which would not have existed without someone proactively creating them. 欲望是关于丰富和创造的。创造力不是稀缺资源，也不会从任何人身上夺走任何东西。相反，创造力实际上创造了新的资源和机会，这些资源和机会以前不存在，如果没有人主动创造，这些资源和机会也不会存在。
2.  Wanting requires no justification. When you want something, you don’t need to justify that want to anyone else. This will be particularly vexing to the self-righteous needers among us who will attempt to manipulate and guilt you into doing what they believe you *should* be doing, based on their scarcity frame of reference. To go 10x, as well as to live the life you are uniquely suited to live, you can’t pay heed to the scarcity-mongers. 想要不需要理由。当你想要某样东西的时候，你不需要向任何人证明你想要的东西。这对于我们当中那些自以为是的需求者来说尤其令人恼火，他们会试图操纵你，让你内疚，让你去做他们认为你应该做的事情，基于他们的稀缺性参照系。要想达到 10 倍，也要过上你唯一适合过的生活，你不能去理会那些稀缺贩子。

I’m going to dissect both of these points in turn. Let’s start with the creation of new resources, which shouldn’t be confused with stealing limited resources. 我将依次剖析这两点。让我们从创建新资源开始，这不应该与窃取有限资源混淆。

In a 2004 essay entitled *How to Make Wealth*, entrepreneur Paul Graham explains the difference between money and wealth. They are not the same thing, but often get confused because money is the typical way of *moving wealth*. 在 2004 年的一篇题为《如何创造财富》的文章中，企业家保罗·格雷厄姆解释了金钱和财富的区别。它们不是一回事，但经常会混淆，因为金钱是转移财富的典型方式。

As Graham explains: 正如 Graham 解释的那样：

“Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn’t matter how much money you had. Wealth is what you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of *moving wealth*, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about *making money* can make it harder to understand how to make money.”^(54) “财富是根本。财富是我们想要的东西：食物、衣服、房子、汽车、小工具、去有趣的地方旅行等等。你可以拥有财富而没有金钱。如果你有一台神奇的机器，它可以根据命令给你造一辆车，给你做饭，洗衣服，或者做任何你想做的事情，你就不需要钱了。然而，如果你在南极洲的中心，那里没有什么东西可以买，你有多少钱都不重要。财富是你想要的，而不是金钱。但如果财富是重要的，为什么每个人都在谈论赚钱？这是一种速记法：货币是转移财富的一种方式，实际上它们通常是可以互换的。但它们不是一回事，除非你打算通过伪造来致富，否则谈论赚钱会让你更难理解如何赚钱。” ^(54)

Money alone is not worth chasing—and if money is all you’re after, you will struggle building wealth—which is valuable assets, skills, and creations. 光靠金钱是不值得追求的如果金钱是你追求的全部，那么你将难以创造财富财富，而财富是宝贵的资产、技能和创造。

When you view money *as* wealth, then it can be easy to fall for what Graham calls “The Pie Fallacy,” which is believing there is a finite amount of wealth available at any one time, and if one person has a lot of the wealth then that takes away from someone else. However, when you realize that wealth and money are *not* the same thing, and that wealth is actually *created*, then you realize there is no finite pie. 当你把金钱看作财富时，你很容易陷入格雷厄姆所谓的“派谬误”，即相信在任何时候都有有限的财富，如果一个人拥有很多财富，那么这就夺走了其他人的财富。然而，当你意识到财富和金钱不是一回事，财富实际上是创造出来的，那么你就会意识到没有有限的馅饼。

Money is an abstraction, it’s a finite game. 金钱是一个抽象概念，是一个有限的游戏。

Wealth is *reality*, it’s an infinite game. 财富是现实，是一场无限的游戏。

There’s no scarcity of wealth. 财富并不稀缺。

Wealth is the byproduct of choosing freedom, and you can create as much wealth *as you want*. 财富是选择自由的副产品，你可以创造你想要的财富。

Graham further explains: Graham 进一步解释道：

“Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is—and you specifically are—one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you’ll get more for it. In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven’t made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was.” “假设你有一辆破旧的汽车。明年夏天，你可以花时间把车恢复到原始状态，而不是坐在你的屁股上。这样做，你就创造了财富。这个世界就是你就是一辆越富越原始的旧车。而不是以某种隐喻的方式。如果你把车卖了，你会得到更多的回报。你修复了你的旧车，使自己富有了.你没有让别人更穷。显然没有固定的馅饼。事实上，当你这样看的时候，你会想知道为什么有人会认为有。“

In simple terms: wealth is *value*. 简而言之：财富就是价值。

Wealth is something that someone *wants—*whether that be a physical commodity, information or knowledge, or some form of service. 财富是一个人想要的东西无论是实物商品、信息或知识，还是某种形式的服务。

Value is *qualitative and subjective*, not quantitative and objective like money is. You can become 10x more valuable and thus wealthy without directly having 10x more money. And indeed, money follows wealth. 价值是定性的、主观的，而不是像货币那样定量的、客观的。你可以变得更有价值 10 倍，从而富有，而不需要直接拥有 10 倍的钱。事实上，金钱是跟随财富而来的。

The quantitative follows the qualitative. 定性之后的定量。

*10x is qualitative. . . 10x 是定性的。. .*

10x occurs as you create more wealth, or value. You do this by creating value that is qualitatively different and better (i.e., innovative) than what currently exists in the market. 10 倍会发生，因为你创造了更多的财富或价值。你可以通过创造质量上不同和更好的价值来做到这一点（即，创新）比目前市场上存在的。

The more specific and specialized the value you can create, the wealthier you can become. You’re creating things that no one else can or would. You’re providing an incredibly useful service that is not only desired but transformative for someone who wants it. 你能创造的价值越具体和专业化，你就能变得越富有。你在创造别人无法或不愿创造的东西。你提供了一个非常有用的服务，不仅是人们想要的，而且对那些想要它的人来说是变革性的。

Wealth and freedom are exactly the same thing. Wealth is qualitative and so is freedom. 财富和自由是一回事。财富是质的，自由也是质的。

Wealth and freedom are about *value*. 财富和自由是关于价值的。

In his program for high-level entrepreneurs, Dan teaches 4 Freedoms that are about value: 在他的高级企业家课程中，Dan 教授了 4 个关于价值的自由：

1.  The *value and quality* of your time 时间的价值和质量
2.  The *value and quality* of your money 你的钱的价值和质量
3.  The *value and quality* of your relationships 你关系的价值和质量
4.  The *value and quality* of your overall purpose 你的整体目的的价值和质量

You can 10x the value and quality of your time, money, relationships, and purpose. *And that’s really what 10x is all about.* 你可以将你的时间、金钱、人际关系和目标的价值和质量提高 10 倍。这就是 10 倍的真正意义所在。

10x is the means, freedom is the end. 10x 是手段，自由是目的。

This is where most people have gotten the entire notion of 10x wrong. They’ve equated 10x solely with money, making it a finite game with a beginning and an end, with winners and losers. 这就是大多数人错误地理解 10 倍的整个概念。他们把 10 倍等同于金钱，使其成为一个有开始和结束、有赢家和输家的有限游戏。

10x is a *qualitative game* of increasing the value of your freedoms—and to do so by creating the wealth (skills, knowledge, products, etc.) you *intrinsically want* to create, and then sharing that wealth with the specific people who increasingly value and appreciate your value. 10 x 是一个增加你自由价值的定性游戏-并通过创造财富（技能，知识，产品等）来实现这一目标。你本质上想创造财富，然后与那些越来越重视和欣赏你价值的特定人分享财富。

When you play 10x as a qualitative game, then you focus on building transformational relationships, not transactional ones. Everything you do is about transforming yourself and the unique value you can bring and providing your increasingly unique value to those you want to form transformational relationships with. 当你把 10 x 作为一个定性游戏玩时，你会专注于建立转型关系，而不是交易关系。你所做的每一件事都是为了改变你自己和你所能带来的独特价值，并为那些你想与之形成转型关系的人提供你日益独特的价值。

Increasing your value involves becoming more specific and specialized in what you create for specific types of people. As you become increasingly valuable, people will pay you increasing amounts of money in exchange for your value. 增加你的价值包括变得更具体和专业化你为特定类型的人创造的东西。当你变得越来越有价值时，人们会付给你越来越多的钱来换取你的价值。

To quote Graham again: 再次引用 Graham 的话：

“The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers. A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and *create wealth*. A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those characters you type are a complete, finished product. If someone sat down and wrote a web browser that didn’t suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world would be that much richer.” “最有可能理解财富是可以创造的，是那些善于制造东西的人，工匠。他们手工制作的物品变成商店里买的。但随着工业化的兴起，工匠越来越少。现存最大的群体之一是计算机程序员。程序员可以坐在电脑前创造财富。一个好的软件本身就是一个有价值的东西。没有制造混淆问题。你输入的那些字符是一个完整的成品。如果有人坐下来写一个不烂的浏览器（顺便说一句，这是个好主意），世界就会变得更加丰富。”

When you live life based on want, rather than need, you’re playing an infinite game. You see that reality is created and chosen—and is based on wealth, freedom, and value. You recognize that each of these things is qualitative, individual, and personal. You’re not competing with anyone else. Instead, you’re collaborating with other abundance-minded creators. 当你生活的基础是欲望，而不是需求，你是在玩一个无限的游戏。你看到现实是被创造和选择的，它是建立在财富、自由和价值的基础上的。你认识到，这些东西中的每一个都是定性的、个体的和个人的。你没有和别人竞争。相反，你正在与其他富有思想的创造者合作。

When you live life based on need, you’re stuck playing a finite game. When you play a finite game, you’re driven and controlled by external forces. You’re competing for scarce resources. You’re focused on and worried about what other people are doing. You’re not clear on who you really are and you’re certainly not peeling the layers of the David away. 当你以需求为基础生活时，你就陷入了一个有限的游戏。当你玩一个有限博弈时，你会被外力驱动和控制。你在争夺稀缺资源。你专注于和担心别人在做什么。你不清楚自己到底是谁，你肯定也没有剥离大卫的层层。

Are you a needer or wanter? 你是一个需要者还是一个需要者？

Are you playing the infinite game of freedom or are you stuck in some finite game? 你是在玩自由的无限游戏，还是陷入了有限游戏？

Are you building qualitative wealth and value, or are you competing for scarce money? 你是在创造优质的财富和价值，还是在争夺稀缺的资金？

According to Dan, there are four distinct differences between needers and wanters: 根据丹的说法，需要者和渴望者之间有四个明显的区别：

1.  Needing is extrinsically motivated, whereas wanting is intrinsically motivated. 需要是外在动机，而想要是内在动机。
2.  Needing is security-driven, whereas wanting is freedom-driven. 需要是安全驱动的，而想要是自由驱动的。
3.  Needing is scarcity-minded, whereas wanting is abundance-minded. 需要是贫乏的，而缺乏是富足的。
4.  Needing is reactive, whereas wanting is creative.^(3) 需要是反应性的，而想要是创造性的。 ^(3)

Committing to what you *want most* is the only way to be free. 致力于你最想要的是获得自由的唯一途径。

If you do anything out of perceived need or compulsion, then you don’t feel it is really your own choice, but rather, you feel the choice is being made for you. You’re being the victim or byproduct of something external. 如果你做任何事情是出于感知的需要或强迫，那么你并不觉得这真的是你自己的选择，相反，你觉得选择是为你而做的。你是外部事物的受害者或副产品。

When you live based on wants, you’re living intrinsically. You’re living on purpose—*your purpose*. You’re living *without need* to rationalize or justify. You’re being, doing, and having what you want simply because you want it, regardless of external opinions or expectations. Y*ou’re creating the life you want by creating the value you want.* 当你生活在欲望的基础上时，你就是在本质上生活。你活在有目的的你的目的。你的生活不需要合理化或辩解。你之所以成为、做、拥有你想要的东西，仅仅是因为你想要它，不管外界的意见或期望如何。你在创造你想要的价值来创造你想要的生活。

This brings us to the second critical point to dissect from Dan’s quotation above: when you live based on wanting, you don’t need to rationalize or justify what you want, *to anyone*. 这就把我们带到了第二个关键点来剖析丹的引用：当你生活在欲望的基础上时，你不需要向任何人解释你想要的东西。

You do what you want, because you want to. 你做你想做的事，因为你想做。

That’s enough. 够了

Wanting is intrinsic. It requires no justification, even though others (the needers among us) will try to force you to rationalize what you want. 欲望是内在的。它不需要理由，即使其他人（我们中间的需要者）会试图强迫你合理化你想要的东西。

Let’s clear this up one more time: you don’t need it. . .*You want it.* And you wanting whatever you want takes nothing away from someone else, because you’re *creating wealth* and freedom, and that actually makes things better for the world, not worse. 我们再澄清一次：你不需要它.你想要它。你想要的任何东西都不会从别人身上夺走任何东西，因为你在创造财富和自由，这实际上让世界变得更好，而不是更糟。

When you operate in the world of needs, you always have to rationalize and justify what you’re doing. You can’t simply do something because you want to. You may want a new house, or to go on a six-week vacation, or to chase some dream. Yet, if you’re operating based on need, you likely won’t do any of these things because they can be hard to rationalize. 当你在充满需求的世界中工作时，你总是要合理化和证明你正在做的事情。你不能仅仅因为你想做就做什么。你可能想要一所新房子，或者去度六周的假期，或者追逐一些梦想。然而，如果你是基于需求来操作，你可能不会做这些事情，因为它们很难合理化。

When you are in a needing frame-of-mind, you can easily be manipulated by other people. Others strive to make you feel guilty for not doing what they think you “need to be” or “should be” doing. 当你处于一个需要的心态中时，你很容易被其他人操纵。其他人努力让你因为没有做他们认为你“需要”或“应该”做的事情而感到内疚。

A public controversial example highlights this perfectly. 一个公开的有争议的例子完美地说明了这一点。

In a recent interview, Tim Ferriss asked Coinbase cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong about dealing with scrutiny and criticism. Specifically, Tim asked Brian about his decision to offer severance packages to employees who disagreed with his stance that Coinbase was a mission-driven company and wouldn’t over-involve itself in cultural, political issues.^(4,5) 在最近的一次采访中，Tim Ferriss 询问 Coinbase 联合创始人兼首席执行官 Brian Armstrong 如何处理审查和批评。具体来说，蒂姆问布莱恩，他决定向那些不同意他的立场的员工提供遣散费，即 Coinbase 是一家以使命为导向的公司，不会过度参与文化和政治问题。 ^(4,5)

Brian explained that during the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020, the tumultuous news cycle, mostly dominated by the tragic murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, created a sense of division across the country—and his team began feeling less connected and cohesive as a result. 布莱恩解释说，在 2020 年新冠疫情爆发之初，动荡的新闻周期主要以乔治·弗洛伊德惨遭谋杀和“黑人命也重要”运动为主导，在全国范围内产生了分裂感--他的团队因此开始感觉彼此之间的联系和凝聚力下降。

As division spread internally within the Coinbase team, the employee culture became political and tense. During bi-weekly town hall meetings, Coinbase employees began asking political and social questions that pressured the company to take a stance on issues like police brutality that fell outside the scope of its mission. As many similarly influential companies publicly took bold stances on social issues, Brian and his team knew they had to respond. 随着 Coinbase 团队内部的分裂蔓延，员工文化变得政治化和紧张。在两周一次的市政厅会议上，Coinbase 的员工开始提出政治和社会问题，迫使公司在警察暴行等问题上采取立场，这些问题超出了其使命范围。当许多同样有影响力的公司公开在社会问题上采取大胆的立场时，布莱恩和他的团队知道他们必须做出回应。

During a closed-door meeting with his leadership team, Brian decided to double down on his company values. At first, he decided that while Coinbase’s mission is not political, he *needed* to follow the tech trends and make a public statement supporting the BLM movement. 在一次与领导团队的闭门会议中，布莱恩决定加倍强调公司的价值观。起初，他决定虽然 Coinbase 的使命不是政治性的，但他需要跟随技术趋势，并发表公开声明支持 BLM 运动。

However, after learning more about the organization, he discovered *BLM* had other objectives beyond racial equality, such as defunding the police in America, which he didn’t think Coinbase could support. 然而，在了解了更多关于该组织的信息后，他发现 BLM 除了种族平等之外还有其他目标，比如削减美国警察的资金，他认为 Coinbase 无法支持这一点。

He realized he had made a mistake, getting swept up in the hype of the cultural moment—at the expense of Coinbase’s mission: increasing economic freedom in the world with crypto. This, he discovered, was the mistake of operating from a place of fear, scarcity, and needing. He knew he had to re-focus his and the company’s energy and culture on the mission at hand. 他意识到自己犯了一个错误，被文化时刻的炒作所淹没--代价是 Coinbase 的使命：用加密货币增加世界的经济自由。他发现，这是在恐惧、匮乏和需要的地方运作的错误。他知道他必须重新将自己和公司的精力和文化集中到手头的使命上。

A few months after he released his initial statement, Brian released a new public statement informing everyone on his team, as well as the outside world, that Coinbase is a *mission-driven company*. To quote Stephen Covey, “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.”^(6) 在发布最初声明几个月后，Brian 发布了一份新的公开声明，告知团队中的每个人以及外界，Coinbase 是一家以使命为驱动的公司。引用斯蒂芬·柯维的话：“最重要的是保持主要的事情。” ^(6)

In the Tim Ferriss interview, Brain explained how he broke the news and made the committed clarification to Coinbase: 在 Tim Ferriss 的采访中，Brain 解释了他是如何爆料的，并向 Coinbase 做出了坚定的澄清：

“This is the direction we’re going in. If you’re not okay with that, I totally get it. I didn’t make it clear up front, that’s my fault. We’re going to give this great severance package. Five percent of the company left. It created a bunch of drama for a few months, a couple journalists wrote hit pieces on us and things like that, but afterwards it was better. It was one of the best things I’ve ever done for the company to be honest. Because now we’re fully aligned, we’re making faster progress, everybody who joins the company knows what they’re signing up for. And it was an incredibly important leadership moment for me because I was terribly scared to do it, I didn’t want the controversy, I knew people were going to hate it.” “这就是我们前进的方向。如果你不同意，我完全理解。我没有把事情说清楚，那是我的错。我们会给予你一笔丰厚的遣散费。公司 5%的人离开了。它创造了一堆戏剧几个月，几个记者写了关于我们的热门文章和类似的事情，但后来它更好。老实说，这是我为公司做过的最好的事情之一。因为现在我们完全一致，我们取得了更快的进展，每个加入公司的人都知道他们签约的目标是什么。这对我来说是一个非常重要的领导时刻，因为我非常害怕这样做，我不想引起争议，我知道人们会讨厌它。

Brian Armstrong did something courageous. He did what he *wanted*, not what others thought he *needed* to do. 布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗做了一件勇敢的事。他做了他想做的事，而不是别人认为他需要做的事。

Living based on want requires courage. 生活在需要的基础上需要勇气。

Living based on want is how you live your life how you want to, not how others want you to. 基于需求而生活是你如何按照你想要的方式生活，而不是别人希望你如何生活。

Wanting what you want is intrinsically motivated. It’s doing something for the sake of it, not because you have to rationalize it. Brian simply wanted to make a company that brought forth economic freedom through crypto. He didn’t need to rationalize that want. He didn’t need any ulterior motives or reasons. 想要你想要的东西是内在的动机。它是为了它而做的事情，而不是因为你必须合理化它。布莱恩只是想打造一家通过加密货币带来经济自由的公司。他不需要为这种需求辩解。他不需要什么别有用心的理由。

Wanting what you want requires a great deal of self-honesty. It takes making a committed stand about who you are and what you’re about, regardless of the repercussions. 想要你想要的东西，需要大量的自我诚实。这需要坚定地表明你是谁，你在做什么，不管后果如何。

Tim Ferriss responded to Brain’s story by saying that a “hallmark of good leadership” is making “unpopular decisions.” 蒂姆·费里斯回应布莱恩的故事时说，“优秀领导力的标志”是做出“不受欢迎的决定”。

Eliminating the 80 percent—whatever that looks like for you—will be unpopular for many people in your world. It will certainly be unpopular for the needers in your world—those who don’t understand the infinite game of freedom and wealth creation you’re playing. 消除这 80%不管你看起来是什么样子对你来说都是不受欢迎的。对于你们世界中的需要者来说，这肯定是不受欢迎的--那些不理解你们正在玩的自由和财富创造的无限游戏的人。

Indeed, as stated previously, a primary reason people don’t go for the 10x upgrades they want is because in the end, they’re too afraid of making those around them who simply wouldn’t get it uncomfortable. They end up buying into the loud agenda of culture and those around them who say they shouldn’t want more than they need. They settle for 2x over 10x and, internally, they can’t overcome the frustration and suppression this creates. Even more, they fail to realize who they truly could have become, the 10x version of themselves that transformed again and again, the David. 事实上，如前所述，人们不去进行他们想要的 10 倍升级的主要原因是，最终，他们太害怕让周围的人不舒服。他们最终会接受文化的响亮议程，以及周围那些说他们不应该想要超过他们需要的东西的人。他们满足于 2 倍超过 10 倍，在内部，他们无法克服挫折和压抑造成的。更重要的是，他们没有意识到他们真正可以成为谁，一次又一次地改变了自己的 10 倍版本，大卫。

There is enormous external pressure to keep the 80 percent in your life, because the 80 percent represents security but not freedom. Even still, the greatest pressure you’ll face is internal. 要保持生活中的 80%，有巨大的外部压力，因为 80%代表安全，而不是自由。即便如此，你面临的最大压力还是来自内心。

Freedom is ultimately internal. 自由最终是内在的。

Do you have the courage to let go of the 80 percent and go all-in on what you truly want? 你是否有勇气放下 80%的东西，全力投入你真正想要的东西？

Being *free* means you let go of everything you think you need and only choose that which you absolutely want. 自由意味着你放弃你认为你需要的一切，只选择你绝对想要的。

Wanting is based on freedom. 欲望是基于自由的。

Needing is based on security, fear, and worry of other people’s judgements. 需要是基于安全感、恐惧和担心他人的判断。

People don’t get what they want because they’re too busy seeking what they believe they need. They become busy chasing means rather than directly choosing and living their desired end. 人们得不到他们想要的东西，因为他们忙碌寻找他们认为需要的东西。他们开始忙碌追求手段，而不是直接选择和生活自己想要的目的。

There are two core types of freedom: 自由有两种核心类型：

1.  Freedom from—which is *externally escaping* from what you don’t want, and is avoidance-motivated. 从外部逃避你不想要的东西，是逃避动机。
2.  Freedom to—which is *internally committing to and courageously choosing* what you most want, and is approach-motivated.^(7,8) 自由--内在承诺并勇敢地选择你最想要的东西，是接近的动力。 ^(7,8)

You could have all the external freedoms in the world but not be free. Similarly, you could *be free* even if all of your external freedoms are taken. As Viktor Frankl said in *Man’s Search for Meaning*, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”^(9) 你可以拥有世界上所有外在的自由，但你不能自由。同样，即使你所有的外在自由都被剥夺了，你也可以自由。正如维克多·弗兰克尔（Viktor Frankl）在《人的意义》（Man’s Search for Meaning）中所说：“在刺激和反应之间，有一个空间。在这个空间里，我们有能力选择我们的反应。在我们的回应中，我们的成长和自由。 ^(9)

Freedom is ultimately an internal choice and commitment, regardless of the finite game you find yourself in any particular moment. 自由最终是一种内在的选择和承诺，无论你在任何特定时刻发现自己是多么有限的游戏。

Freedom and wanting both transcend context. They operate above context. They aren’t defined by the rules of a given context. Instead, they utilize a higher plane to transform the context and game (i.e., reality) entirely. 自由和欲望都超越了语境。他们在上下文之上运作。它们不是由给定上下文的规则来定义的。相反，它们利用更高的平面来变换上下文和游戏（即，现实）完全。

*You know internally whether you’re free.* You’re free when you choose what you want and you go for it, rather than accepting what you think you need. 你知道自己是否自由。当你选择你想要的东西，你去争取它，而不是接受你认为你需要的东西时，你是自由的。

Nothing happens until after you commit, and it’s only *after* you commit that you know what freedom feels like. As the popular saying goes, “Everything you want is on the opposite side of fear.”^(10) 只有在你承诺之后才会发生任何事情，只有在你承诺之后，你才知道自由是什么感觉。正如流行的谚语所说，“你想要的一切都在恐惧的对立面。” ^(10)

An obvious challenge people face is that they *don’t know what they want*. They’re far too busy justifying what they think they need. They haven’t learned to be brutally honest with themselves and others. They’re still living in fear. 人们面临的一个明显挑战是他们不知道自己想要什么。他们忙碌着证明自己需要的东西。他们还没有学会对自己和他人残酷地诚实。他们仍然生活在恐惧中。

Learning to clarify what you want without justification or apology is vital to going 10x since 10x is based on want, not need. Indeed, no one *needs* to go 10x. 学会在没有理由或道歉的情况下澄清你想要什么是至关重要的，因为 10x 是基于想要，而不是需要。事实上，没有人需要 10x。

Elon Musk doesn’t need to go to Mars, *he wants to*. Elon Musk 不需要去火星，他想去。

Martin Luther King Jr. didn’t need to rally for racial equality and freedoms, *he wanted to*. 马丁·路德·金他不需要为种族平等和自由集会，他想这样做。

You don’t need that new car, you want it. Or you don’t. *It’s okay either way.* 你不需要那辆新车，你想要它。或者你不知道不管怎样都没关系。

Wanting is based on freedom and abundance. 欲望是建立在自由和富足之上的。

Wanting is based on honesty with yourself and the whole world—you’re no longer trying to pose and posture based on what others think. You’re living your life how you want, and you’re being yourself. 想要是建立在对自己和整个世界诚实的基础上你不再试图根据别人的想法来摆姿势。你过着你想要的生活，做你自己。

As the *A*lcoholics Anonymous founder Bill W. stated, “All progress starts by telling the truth.” 正如匿名戒酒协会创始人比尔·W。他说：“一切进步都始于说出真相。

To be free, you can’t keep lying to yourself. 为了自由，你不能一直欺骗自己。

Living in a world of needs and rationalizations is prison. It locks you into relationships and situations you don’t want but maintain out of fear and perceived security or obligation. 生活在一个充满需求和理性化的世界里，就是监狱。它把你锁在你不想要的关系和情况中，但出于恐惧和感知的安全感或义务而维持。

To be free, you must first be completely honest with yourself. Being honest with yourself starts by admitting to yourself what you want most. 要想获得自由，你首先必须对自己完全诚实。对自己诚实首先要承认自己最想要的东西。

Not what you think you want. 不是你想要的。

Not what you think you need. 不是你认为你需要的。

But what you truly—at your core—want. 但你真正的-在你的核心-想要的。

Until you can admit and commit to what you want, then you’re not free. 除非你能承认并承诺你想要的，否则你就不是自由的。

When you live based on freedom and want, then your life starts transforming in qualitative and non-linear ways. You stop operating in the finite-minded world of other people’s goals and rules. 当你生活在自由和欲望的基础上时，你的生活开始以质的和非线性的方式转变。你停止在别人的目标和规则的有限的世界里运作。

You stop being like anyone else entirely. 你不再像其他人一样。

You start fully embracing the *uniqueness* that is you. And *you are* unique. No one else is like you and no one else *can* or *truly wants* to be like you. The best thing you can do is embrace and value your uniqueness. Then live that out in the world in your highest and purest form by helping others in the way only you can. 你开始完全接受你的独特性。你是独一无二的。没有人会像你一样，也没有人会像你一样。你能做的最好的事情就是拥抱和珍惜你的独特性。然后，以你最高和最纯粹的形式生活在世界上，以你唯一能做到的方式帮助他人。

You develop your unique mastery by going 10x again and again, choosing freedom over security, and going all-in on the 20 percent that both excites and terrifies you. You peel away the 80 percent and become your own David, which is unique and like no one else. 你通过一次又一次的 10 倍来发展你独特的掌握能力，选择自由而不是安全，并全力以赴地投入 20%的既兴奋又害怕你。你剥离了 80%，成为你自己的大卫，这是独一无二的，没有其他人。

It all boils down to wanting what you want. 一切都归结为你想要的。

What do you truly want, more than anything else? 你真正想要的是什么，比什么都重要？

What would excite you more than anything else to be, do, and have? 有什么能比任何事情更让你兴奋，去做，去拥有？

What would you be and do if you weren’t afraid of what others thought or the repercussions? 如果你不害怕别人的想法或后果，你会做什么？

How would it feel to be more honest and real with yourself and the world? 对自己和世界更加诚实和真实的会是什么感觉？

The highest and Fourth of Dan’s 4 Freedoms is *Freedom of Purpose*—doing what you most want to do, which is the highest and purest expression of yourself—your purpose for being. 丹的四种自由中最高的也是第四种自由是目的自由--做你最想做的事，这是你自己最高、最纯粹的表达--你的存在目的。

As you continue evolving as a person, your sense of vision and purpose for yourself and your life will expand to unbelievable levels. You’ll progressively want to give more and more of yourself and your resources to the betterment of the world, in your own unique way. 随着你作为一个人的不断发展，你对自己和你的生活的愿景和目标将扩展到难以置信的水平。你会逐渐地想要以自己独特的方式，把自己和你的资源奉献给世界的更好。

## Clarify and Define Your Unique Ability 阐明和定义你的独特能力

*“Unique Ability requires you to determine what you personally like and dislike doing, and decide that others’ opinions about it are irrelevant. The basis of Unique Ability is to continually be conscious of the activities and* *the settings you like and that energize you—and the things that don’t. This is where freedom starts: with the understanding that your own judgments about your own experience are 100 percent valid… Unique Ability is really amazing. And I have to tell you, it never is a lot of different activities. It’s only a few activities. People say, ‘Well, I have a Unique Ability in 10 different areas. And I say, ‘Well, that might be good for the next 90 days. But you’re going to notice at the end of 90 days that seven of those someone else could do. There’s just 2–3 that are really yours.’ I’ve been on this now for 25–30 years and it’s interesting that you think you’ve gotten to the end of it. But I find, because I’m always doing new things, that what I thought was my Unique Ability before I started taking on a bigger challenge and producing a bigger result, you can fine-tune it even more.”* “特殊能力需要你确定你个人喜欢和不喜欢做什么，并决定其他人对它的看法是无关紧要的。独特能力的基础是不断地意识到你喜欢的活动和环境，并能激发你的活力--以及那些没有的事情。这就是自由开始的地方：理解你自己对自己经历的判断是 100%有效的...独特的能力真的很神奇。我必须告诉你，从来没有很多不同的活动。这只是一些活动。人们会说，‘嗯，我有 10 个不同领域的独特能力。我说，‘好吧，这在接下来的 90 天里可能很好。但你会注意到，在 90 天结束时，其中 7 天是别人可以做到的。只有 2-3 个是你的。我已经做了 25-30 年了，有趣的是，你认为你已经走到了尽头。 但我发现，因为我总是在做新的事情，在我开始接受更大的挑战并产生更大的结果之前，我认为是我的独特能力，你可以更好地调整它。“

**— DAN SULLIVAN^(11) - DAN SULIVAN ^(11)**

In May of 2014, Nike released the “P-ROD 8,” American skateboarder Paul Rodriguez’s eighth signature shoe. 2014 年 5 月，Nike 发布了美国滑板运动员 Paul Rodriguez 的第八款签名鞋“P-ROD 8”。

When the shoe was released, Nike informed P-Rod that he was only one of four athletes to ever release eight unique signature shoes. The other three athletes were Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James . . . 当这双鞋发布时，耐克告诉 P-Rod，他是唯一一个四个运动员发布了八个独特的签名鞋。其他三名运动员分别是科比·布莱恩特、迈克尔·乔丹和勒布朗·詹姆斯。. .

Having a signature shoe with *Nike* is an extremely rare feat. Over the company’s 40-plus-year history, less than one percent of Nike’s athletes have received the coveted honor. To have a Nike shoe that carries your own name or nickname on it, though, that’s even rarer still. Consider the football legend Bo Jackson, whose signature Nike shoe was called the Air Trainer SC. It wasn’t called The Bo. 拥有 Nike 的签名鞋款是极其罕见的壮举。在公司 40 多年的历史中，只有不到 1%的耐克运动员获得了这一令人垂涎的荣誉。不过，要有一双印有自己名字或昵称的耐克鞋，那就更罕见了。想想足球传奇人物博·杰克逊，他的标志性耐克鞋名为 Air Trainer SC。它不叫波。

Back in 2005, Nike was making its second attempt to succeed in the skateboarding market and subculture. The 21-year-old P-Rod was one of the world’s top skateboarders at the time, and Nike made P-Rod an amazing offer to join the Nike team. Despite being an incredible opportunity, P-Rod had long dreamed of having his own signature skate-shoe, and Nike did not make him that offer. 早在 2005 年，耐克就在滑板市场和亚文化领域进行了第二次尝试。21 岁的 P-Rod 是当时世界顶级滑板运动员之一，耐克向 P-Rod 提出了加入耐克团队的惊人提议。尽管这是一个难以置信的机会，P-Rod 一直梦想拥有自己的签名滑板鞋，耐克并没有给他这个机会。

In his 2022 interview—*20 and Forever*—reflecting on 20 years of skateboarding and his career as a whole, P-Rod stated: 在他 2022 年的采访-20 和永远-反思 20 年的滑板和他的整个职业生涯，P-Rod 说：

“My dream when I started skateboarding was to have a signature board and a signature shoe. To me, that’s wholly completing the pro skater dream. So, if I didn’t get a shoe, I feel like my dream would be incomplete. My manager was talking to [Nike], negotiating, and said to me, ‘Okay, here’s what they want to offer. Here’s what the terms of the deal are.’ And I was like, ‘That all sounds good, but what about a pro shoe? What about a signature shoe?’ She’s like, ‘They didn’t mention anything about it.’ So, she went back to Nike and called me back, ‘They’re not planning to do signature shoes.’ I was literally like, ‘Nope! I’m perfectly happy where I’m at.’ I wasn’t planning on leaving [éS, his previous shoe sponsor]. I was just young and stubborn and stuck to my guns.”^(12) “当我开始玩滑板时，我的梦想是拥有一个签名板和一个签名鞋。对我来说，这完全完成了职业滑冰运动员的梦想。所以，如果我没有一双鞋，我觉得我的梦想将是不完整的。我的经理正在和耐克谈判，并对我说，‘好吧，这是他们想要提供的。交易的条件是这样的。我想，‘这听起来不错，但一双职业鞋呢？’有没有一双签名鞋？'她说，“他们什么都没提。于是，她回到耐克公司，给我回了电话，“他们不打算做招牌鞋。”我真的很想，'不！我对现在的处境非常满意。”我并不打算离开[他以前的鞋子赞助商]。我只是年轻而固执，坚持我的枪。“ ^(12)

Looking back, P-Rod is sometimes freaked out by the implications of that moment in time. In 2022, he released his tenth signature shoe with Nike, and his shoes have been among the top selling of *all skateboard shoes* since 2005, selling millions of pairs. He says, 回头看，P-Rod 有时会被那一刻的影响吓坏。2022 年，他与耐克合作发布了自己的第十款签名鞋，自 2005 年以来，他的鞋子一直是所有滑板鞋中销量最高的一款，卖出了数百万双。他说

“I literally think about that story and can’t believe it. What if they had just come back and said, ‘Okay, nope.’ What would have happened? I’m just grateful they came back and believed in me that much. And there we went, 10 signature shoes later.” “我真的想到了这个故事，简直不敢相信。如果他们只是回来说，'好吧，不。'会发生什么？我很感激他们能回来并且那么信任我。然后我们去了，10 双签名鞋之后。

P-Rod is one of the best skateboarders to ever touch a board. He’s unique and technical. His style precise and powerful. He’s innovated and transformed what “skateboarding” means to hundreds of thousands of skaters. P-Rod 是最好的滑板运动员之一，有史以来触摸板。他是独一无二的技术。他的风格精确而有力。他创新并改变了“滑板”对成千上万的滑冰者意味着什么。

*P-Rod is a 10x person* that has had an extremely long career for a skateboarder. He’s never plateaued or gotten stuck but has continually evolved and innovated himself, his focus, and his craft. P-Rod 是一个 10 倍的人，有一个非常长的职业生涯的滑板。他从来没有停滞不前或陷入困境，但不断地进化和创新自己，他的重点和他的手艺。

At age 14, after just a few years of skating, P-Rod submitted his first “Sponsor Me” video to Andy Netkin, the manager of a local skateboard shop named One Eighteen in Los Angeles. Netkin immediately saw P-Rod as a future superstar.^(13) 14 岁时，在滑冰几年后，P-Rod 向洛杉矶当地一家名为 One Eighty 的滑板店的经理 Andy Netkin 提交了他的第一个“Sponsor Me”视频。Netkin 立即将 P-Rod 视为未来的超级巨星。 ^(13)

At age 16, P-Rod got sponsored as an amateur by the skateboard company City Stars, and two years later premiered in their long-awaited skate video *Street Cinema*.^(14) He even got the closing part of the video, which is usually reserved for one of the most esteemed pros on the team.^(15) 16 岁时，P-Rod 作为业余爱好者获得滑板公司 City Stars 的赞助，两年后在他们期待已久的滑板视频 Street Cinema 中首映。 ^(14) 他甚至得到了视频的结尾部分，这部分通常是留给球队中最受尊敬的职业球员之一的。 ^(15)

At 19, P-Rod was featured in the prestigious Transworld Skateboarding 2002 video *In Bloom*. In the beginning montage of his video part, there is commentary from skateboarding legend Eric Koston, who describing P-Rod stated: 19 岁时，P-Rod 出现在著名的 Transworld Skateboarding 2002 视频 In Bloom 中。在他的视频部分的开头蒙太奇中，有滑板传奇人物 Eric Koston 的评论，他描述 P-Rod 说：

“His whole deal is natural, like it’s hard for him to fall. He’s just manufacturing tricks out like a conveyer belt. Cause it comes way too easy for him. He’s got something going on that’s pretty good. That’s for sure. Cause it works. He learns so fast. Whatever it is he does, it looks like he was meant to anyways. Beware of the flare. Just watch out.”^(16) “他的整个交易是自然的，就像他很难摔倒一样。他只是在制造传送带。因为这对他来说太容易了。他有很好的事情。那是肯定的。因为这很管用。他学得真快。不管他做了什么，看起来他都是注定要做的。小心照明弹。小心点。” ^(16)

A crucial reason for P-Rod’s continued evolution and success is that he’s been operating within his Unique Ability. P-Rod 的持续进化和成功的一个关键原因是他一直在他的独特能力内运作。

Your Unique Ability is the purest and most honest expression of yourself. It’s the center of who you are—“the David”. . . the “20 percent” of any particular 10x jump. 你的独特能力是你自己最纯粹、最诚实的表达。它是你的中心-“大卫”。. .任何特定 10 倍跳跃的“20%”。

Your Unique Ability is *how you create value and wealth* that is unique and specialized. It’s your radically unique way of doing what you do, such that no one else can compete with you even if they wanted to. Your Unique Ability is also your unique vision and purpose—your “why” for what you’re doing. 你的独特能力是你如何创造独特和专业的价值和财富。这是你做你所做的事情的根本独特的方式，以至于没有人可以与你竞争，即使他们想。你的独特能力也是你独特的愿景和目的--你为什么要做你所做的事情。

After coaching tens of thousands of entrepreneurs for nearly 50 years, Dan Sullivan has seen that those who take their Unique Ability seriously, meaning they take *themselves* seriously, are the ones who make the biggest 10x leaps. 在指导了数万名企业家近 50 年后，丹·沙利文发现，那些认真对待自己独特能力的人，也就是认真对待自己，是实现最大 10 倍飞跃的人。

The reason is simple: Unique Ability is qualitative and individual, it’s extremely unique value that *only you* can create. It’s not just what you do, but *how* you do it. P-Rod doesn’t just skateboard with an extreme degree of skill but also an extreme degree of *uniqueness*—which is actually a core component of mastery. 原因很简单：独特的能力是质的和个体的，它是只有你才能创造的极其独特的价值。这不仅仅是你做什么，而是你如何做。P-Rod 滑板不仅具有极高的技巧，而且具有极高的独特性，这实际上是掌握技能的核心组成部分。

Your Unique Ability is where you have superior skills, where you’re completely intrinsically motivated and thus energized and engaged, and it’s also where you see never-ending possibility for improvement. 你的独特能力是你拥有上级技能的地方，你完全有内在的动力，因此充满活力和投入，也是你看到永无止境的改进可能性的地方。

When most entrepreneurs begin working with Strategic Coach, they find that far less than 20 percent of their time is focused within their Unique Ability. Instead, they’re investing their time, energy, and focus all over the place. They’re caught up in the 80 percent where they may be good or even excellent, but they’re not in their Unique Ability. 当大多数企业家开始与 Strategic Coach 合作时，他们发现他们只有不到 20%的时间专注于他们的独特能力。相反，他们把时间、精力和注意力都投入到各个地方。他们被困在 80%的能力中，他们可能是优秀的，甚至是优秀的，但他们没有在他们的独特能力。

As someone takes their Unique Ability seriously and shifts the majority of their time to developing it, 10x and non-linear jumps follow. 当有人认真对待他们的独特能力，并将大部分时间转移到发展它时，10 倍和非线性跳跃随之而来。

An obvious and important question that comes up with Unique Ability is whether it’s nature or nurture. The not-so-satisfying answer is that it’s *both*. 一个明显而重要的问题是，独特能力是天生的还是后天的。不太令人满意的答案是两者都有。

We all have a Unique Ability—the purest and freest expression of our self and our purpose—but not everyone commits to and develops their Unique Ability. 我们都有一种独特的能力--最纯粹、最自由地表达我们的自我和我们的目标--但不是每个人都致力于并发展他们的独特能力。

Your Unique Ability is personal and internal. Therefore, it takes being honest with yourself about what you most want. 你的独特能力是个人的和内在的。因此，你需要对自己诚实地知道你最想要的是什么。

What you most want and your Unique Ability are connected. You must embrace that you yourself are a unique individual. You’ve got to value your own uniqueness, which also means valuing and appreciating the uniqueness of everyone else. 你最想要的东西和你的独特能力是联系在一起的。你必须接受你自己是一个独特的个体。你必须重视自己的独特性，这也意味着重视和欣赏其他人的独特性。

Committing to your Unique Ability—the thing you want to do and which excites you most—takes extreme commitment and courage. It takes not worrying about what anyone else thinks about what you do and how you live. 致力于你的独特能力--你想做的事情，也是最让你兴奋的事情--需要极大的承诺和勇气。它需要不去担心别人对你做什么和你如何生活的看法。

You’ve got to fully bet on yourself. 你得把赌注全押在自己身上。

Although Unique Ability may come “naturally” to you, that is misleading. Committing to your Unique Ability is the hardest and most intense thing you will ever do. 虽然独特的能力可能是“自然”的你，这是误导。致力于你的独特能力是你将做过的最困难和最激烈的事情。

It’s pure commitment and courage. 这是纯粹的承诺和勇气。

It’s never-ending. 这是永无止境的。

It’s freedom and how you build your most unique value, which the right people will immediately recognize and appreciate beyond what you can presently imagine. 这是自由和你如何建立你最独特的价值，合适的人会立即认识和欣赏超出你目前所能想象的。

The more you commit to your Unique Ability—which is the 20 percent of a chosen 10x jump—the more you and your life will transform. 你越致力于你的独特能力--即所选择的 10 倍跳跃的 20%--你和你的生活就会改变得越多。

You’re not being inhibited by what other people think. 你不会被别人的想法所束缚。

You’re not avoiding what you ultimately want to do. 你并不是在逃避你最终想做的事情。

This is why things come *easier* for you when you’re in your Unique Ability than they come for other people. It’s not that things are “easy” for you. It’s that you’re going all-in on what you most want to do, and because you’re all-in, you grow and transform at non-linear and exponential levels. 这就是为什么当你处于你的独特能力时，事情对你来说比对其他人来说更容易。这并不是说事情对你来说很“容易”。这就是你在你最想做的事情上全力以赴，因为你全力以赴，你在非线性和指数级增长和转化。

You learn 10x faster than most people. 你比大多数人快 10 倍。

You progress 10x faster than seems normal. 你的进步比正常的快 10 倍。

You make leaps in your progression, skills, and results that are otherworldly. 你的进步、技能和结果都是超凡脱俗的。

When you embrace your Unique Ability, work becomes play. As you follow your curiosity and interests, you become open to new potential and possibilities. 当你拥抱你的独特能力时，工作就变成了游戏。当你追随自己的好奇心和兴趣时，你会对新的潜力和可能性敞开心扉。

You reach outside and above your current skill-level, which enables greater flow and higher performance. You’re continually elevating your standards within your domain, making them higher and more nuanced and unique. No one else is competing with you. You’re in your own world of creativity and innovation. 你超越了你目前的技能水平，从而实现了更大的流动和更高的绩效。你在你的领域内不断提高你的标准，使它们更高，更细致和独特。没有人和你竞争。你在自己的创造力和创新世界里。

For you, because you’re continually pushing your boundaries, it’s intense and hard, but it’s also extremely *liberating*. To not be free is much harder than being free. Despite being excruciatingly scary and hard, *it’s much easier than the alternative*. And the freedom, wealth, and benefits of embracing your Unique Ability are 10x or more than the grind of just doing something because you can, or because you believe you should. 对你来说，因为你不断地挑战你的界限，这是紧张和艰难的，但它也是极度的解放。不自由比自由更难。尽管它非常可怕和艰难，但它比其他选择容易得多。拥抱你的独特能力所带来的自由、财富和好处，是仅仅因为你能做，或者因为你相信你应该做的事情的 10 倍或更多。

When you’re operating in Unique Ability, you’re always raising the stakes and attempting things you’ve never done before. You’re always seeing how far you can possibly go. Because you’re in flow and beyond your current capability and confidence, you’re courageously elevating beyond where you’ve previously been. 当你在独特能力中操作时，你总是在提高赌注，尝试你以前从未做过的事情。你总是看到你能走多远。因为你在心流中，超越了你现在的能力和信心，你勇敢地超越了你以前的水平。

You’re continually letting your most exciting future dictate what you commit to, and you go all-in. You don’t become complacent and content with what you’ve done in the past. You don’t settle for 2x. 你不断地让你最激动人心的未来决定了你的承诺，你全力以赴。你不会对过去所做的事情感到自满和满足。你不会满足于 2x。

As Robert Greene explained in *Mastery*: 正如罗伯特·格林在《掌握》中解释的那样：

“The great Masters in history. . . they excel by their ability to practice harder and move faster through the process, all of this stemming from the intensity of their desire to learn and from the deep connection they feel to their field of study. And at the core of this intensity of effort is in fact a quality that is genetic and inborn—not talent or brilliance, which is something that must be developed, but rather a deep and powerful *inclination* toward a particular subject. This inclination is a reflection of a person’s uniqueness. This uniqueness is not something merely poetic or philosophical—it is a scientific fact that genetically, every one of us is unique; our exact genetic makeup has never happened before or will never be repeated… With those who stand out by their later mastery, they experience this inclination more deeply and clearly than others. They experience it as an inner calling. It tends to dominate their thoughts and dreams. They find their way, by accident or sheer effort, to a career path in which this inclination can flourish. This intense connection and desire allows them to withstand the pain of the process—the self-doubts, the tedious hours of practice and study, the inevitable setbacks, the endless barbs from the envious.”^(17) “历史上伟大的大师。. .他们之所以出类拔萃，是因为他们在学习过程中更努力地练习和更快地前进，所有这些都源于他们强烈的学习欲望和他们对所学领域的深刻联系。而这种努力的核心其实是一种天生的品质，不是天赋或才华，那是必须发展的，而是对某一特定学科的深刻而有力的倾向。这种倾向反映了一个人的独特性。这种独特性不仅仅是诗意的或哲学的东西--这是一个科学事实，从基因上讲，我们每个人都是独一无二的;我们确切的基因构成以前从未发生过，也永远不会重复......对于那些因后来的掌握而脱颖而出的人来说，他们比其他人更深刻、更清楚地体验到这种倾向。他们把它当作一种内在的召唤。它往往主宰他们的思想和梦想。 他们通过偶然或纯粹的努力，找到了自己的职业道路，在这个道路上，这种倾向可以蓬勃发展。这种强烈的联系和渴望使他们能够承受这个过程中的痛苦自我怀疑，冗长的练习和学习，不可避免的挫折，嫉妒者无休止的挖苦。“第 0#个

Your Unique Ability is not linear or static. Just as the 20 percent of each 10x jump will be different, the expression and focus of your Unique Ability will also be different in each 10x jump. Just because something was a Unique Ability activity in the past doesn’t mean it still is. 你的独特能力不是线性的或静态的。就像每一次 10 倍跳跃的百分之二十不同一样，你的异能表现和重点在每一次 10 倍跳跃中也会有所不同。仅仅因为某件事在过去是一个特殊能力活动并不意味着它现在仍然是。

Your Unique Ability is always evolving and directed at your most exciting future. 你的独特能力总是在不断发展，并指向你最激动人心的未来。

It’s always taking you to the core of who you are and your highest purpose—the David. 它总是把你带到你是谁的核心和你的最高目标-大卫。

There’s no end to peeling away the layers. 层层剥离是永无止境的。

Each 10x jump you make will non-linearly and qualitatively transform you as a person. 你的每一次 10 倍跳跃都将非线性地、定性地改变你作为一个人。

Each 10x jump will take you and your life in surprising directions. Take for example, Michelangelo, who went from drawing human bodies to sculpting the 17-foot David to painting the Sistine Chapel to becoming the lead architect of the massive dome of St. Peter’s Cathedral. 每一次 10 倍的跳跃都会带你和你的生活走向令人惊讶的方向。以米开朗基罗为例，他从画人体到雕刻 17 英尺高的大卫雕像，再到画西斯廷教堂，再到成为圣教堂巨大圆顶的首席建筑师。彼得大教堂

None of these 10x jumps were linear, but each were completely intrinsic and intuitive to Michelangelo. Each 10x jump he made required him to renovate the foundation he’d built in his previous 10x cycles, often in a lateral or non-linear direction that only made sense when “connecting the dots backward.” 这些 10 倍跳跃都不是线性的，但每一次跳跃都是米开朗基罗的内在和直觉。他每做 10 倍跳跃都要求他重新修复他在之前的 10 倍循环中建立的基础，通常是横向或非线性方向，只有当“连接点向后”时才有意义。

As P-Rod stated in his *20 and Forever* interview: 正如 P-Rod 在他的 20 and Forever 采访中所说：

“The one saying that my dad told me when I was younger was, ‘What got you there will keep you there.’ He was trying to prove the point that just because you think you’ve made it, doesn’t mean it’s time to take it easy. It means it’s time to keep it going.”^(18) “我父亲在我年轻的时候告诉我的一句话是，‘让你在那里的东西会让你在那里。’”他试图证明一个观点，仅仅因为你认为你已经成功了，并不意味着是时候放松了。这意味着是时候让它继续下去了。” ^(18)

Your life’s objective is to *develop mastery in* and *fully express* your Unique Ability. There’s nothing more important to master. There’s nothing more important to dedicate yourself to. It’s *your* work. Your life’s work, and if you don’t do it, no one else will. 你生活的目标是培养掌握并充分表达你的独特能力。没有什么比掌握更重要的了。没有比这更重要的事了。这是你的工作你一生的工作，如果你不做，别人也不会做。

A simple, profound, and somewhat comical story highlights the importance of dedicating yourself to your Unique Ability and purpose above that of anything else. While working on his seminal research on “flow,” Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the originator of the concept, emailed the management master Peter Drucker, seeking to interview him about creativity. Drucker’s response blew Csikszentmihalyi’s mind so much that he included it in his book: 一个简单，深刻，有点滑稽的故事突出了奉献自己的独特能力和目标的重要性，高于任何其他。在他对“心流”的开创性研究中，博士这个概念的创始人米哈里·奇克森特米哈里（Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi）给管理大师彼得·德鲁克（Peter Drucker）发了电子邮件，希望就创造力问题采访他。德鲁克的回答让奇克森米哈里大为震惊，以至于他把这句话写进了自己的书中：

“I am greatly honored and flattered by your kind letter of February 14th — for I have admired you and your work for many years, and I have learned much from it. But, my dear Professor Csikszentmihalyi, I am afraid I have to disappoint you. I could not possibly answer your questions. I am told I am creative — I don’t know what that means. . . I just keep on plodding. . . I hope that you will not think me presumptuous or rude if I say that one of the secrets of productivity (in which I believe whereas I do not believe in creativity) is to have a VERY BIG waste paper basket to take care of ALL invitations such as yours—productivity in my experience consists of NOT doing anything that helps the work of other people but to spend all one’s time on the work that Good Lord has fitted one to do, and to do well.”^(19) “我非常荣幸和荣幸地收到你 2 月 14 日的来信-因为我钦佩你和你的工作多年，我从中学到了很多东西。但是，我亲爱的奇克森米哈里教授，恐怕我不得不让你失望了。我不可能回答你的问题。我被告知我很有创造力-我不知道那是什么意思。. .我只是继续缓慢前进。. .我希望你不要认为我放肆或粗鲁，如果我说生产力的秘诀之一（我相信而我不相信创造力）是有一个非常大的废纸篓来照顾所有的邀请，如你的-生产力在我的经验包括不做任何有助于他人工作的事情，但花所有的一个。“好的上帝，让一个人去做的工作，而且做得好。 ^(19)

The more you explore and refine your Unique Ability, the more you’re doing your work, not someone else’s. You’ll reach a level of *unique mastery* that becomes increasingly obvious and impactful to yourself and those around you, the more your life’s work begins to feel like a *sacred calling.* Your Unique Ability defines and clarifies your *Mastery*—what you and you alone are uniquely suited to do. 你越是探索和完善你的独特能力，你就越是在做你的工作，而不是别人的工作。你将达到一个独特的掌握的水平，变得越来越明显和影响你自己和你周围的人，你的生活工作开始感觉像是一个神圣的使命。你的独特能力定义并阐明了你的掌握--你和你自己唯一适合做的事情。

Research shows that when someone subjectively feels their work is a *calling*—meaning they have a *sense of purpose*, and that they’re *doing what they are meant to do*—that they experience greater overall subjective well-being or happiness as well as greater career success than those who view their work as a *job* or *career*.^(20) Viewing your work as a “calling” need not be tied to any religious belief system, though it can be. 研究表明，当一个人主观上觉得他们的工作是一种召唤意味着他们有目标感，他们正在做他们应该做的事情时，他们会体验到更大的主观幸福感或幸福感，以及更大的事业成功，而那些将工作视为一份工作或事业的人。 ^(20) 将你的工作视为一种“召唤”，不需要与任何宗教信仰体系相联系，尽管它可以。

Research has found a consistent link between feeling a sense of calling and heightened levels of career maturity, career commitment, work meaning, job satisfaction, life meaning, and life satisfaction. These links appear most robust when people are actually living out their calling at work.^(21) 研究发现，感觉到召唤感与职业成熟度、职业承诺、工作意义、工作满意度、生活意义和生活满意度之间存在一致的联系。当人们真正在工作中实现自己的使命时，这些联系显得最为牢固。 ^(21)

Other research shows that individuals who have a sense of calling are more likely to ignore career advice from mentors or advisors, particularly advice suggesting more secure or mainstream options.^(22) This doesn’t mean they don’t listen or take advice, but that in the end, they ultimately trust their inner voice and make their own decisions. 其他研究表明，有使命感的人更有可能忽视导师或顾问的职业建议，特别是建议更安全或主流选择的建议。这并不意味着他们不倾听或接受建议，但最终，他们会相信自己内心的声音，并做出自己的决定。

At the end of the day, no one can make your decisions for you. 在一天结束的时候，没有人能替你做决定。

No one is you. 没有人是你。

No one has your unique vision or way of approaching life. 没有人拥有你独特的视野或接近生活的方式。

No one has your Unique Ability. 没有人拥有你的独特能力。

Thus, other people’s advice can only take you so far. 所以，别人的建议只能带你走到这一步。

This reality hit me hard while writing this book. I was experiencing a great desire to go 10x in various areas of my life and work. But in order to do so, I had to have some difficult and uncomfortable conversations, which were high-stakes and had huge consequences. Many of my greatest mentors and advisors suggested I don’t have these uncomfortable conversations, but instead, to play it safe. 这一现实在我写这本书时给了我很大的打击。我经历了一个巨大的愿望去 10 倍在我的生活和工作的各个领域。但为了做到这一点，我不得不进行一些艰难和不舒服的谈话，这是高风险和巨大的后果。我的许多最伟大的导师和顾问建议我不要进行这些令人不舒服的谈话，而是要谨慎行事。

I was told by multiple people that I’d lose my greatest opportunities, current and future, if I went forward with what I felt in my heart I *wanted* to do. In the end, I listened to myself and made important adjustments in various relationships and situations, and rather than destroying the relationship, my honesty built greater trust, commitment, and freedom for all. 很多人告诉我，如果我继续做我心中想做的事情，我将失去我最好的机会，无论是现在还是未来。最后，我听从自己的意见，在各种关系和情况下做出了重要的调整，我的诚实没有破坏关系，而是为所有人建立了更大的信任、承诺和自由。

*Trusting yourself* and forging your unique path is actually what Robert Greene calls the “X factor” of *mastery*. As he explains: 相信自己，打造自己独特的道路，实际上就是罗伯特·格林所说的掌握的“X 因素”。正如他解释的那样：

“Mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge. But there is another element, an X factor that Mastery inevitably possess, that seems mystical but is accessible to us all. Whatever field of activity we are involved in, there is generally an accepted path to the top. . . But Masters have a strong inner guiding system and a high level of self-awareness. Inevitably, these Masters, as they progress in their career paths, make a choice at a key moment in their lives: they decide to forge their own route, one that others will see as unconventional, but that suits their own spirit and rhythms and leads them closer to discovering the hidden truths of their object of study. This key choice takes self-confidence and self-awareness—the X factor that is necessary for attaining mastery.” “精通不是天才或天赋的功能。它是时间的函数，并且是应用于特定知识领域的强烈关注。但还有另一个元素，一个 X 因素，掌握不可避免地拥有，看起来神秘，但我们所有人都可以接近。无论我们从事哪一个领域的活动，通常都有一条公认的通往顶端的道路。. .但是大师们有一个强大的内在引导系统和高度的自我意识。不可避免的是，这些大师在他们的职业道路上取得进展时，在他们生命中的关键时刻做出了选择：他们决定开创自己的路线，一条别人会认为是非常规的，但符合他们自己的精神和节奏，并使他们更接近发现他们研究对象隐藏的真理。这个关键的选择需要自信和自我意识--这是达到精通所必需的 X 因素。”

Mastery is not just the ability to do something well. It’s the ability to do something *uniquely well*. If it’s not unique, innovative, and uninhibited self-expression, *then it’s not true mastery*. Mastery and uniqueness are inseparable. 掌握不仅仅是做好某件事的能力。它是一种独特地做好某事的能力。如果它不是独特的、创新的、不受约束的自我表达，那么它就不是真正的掌握。精通和独特是分不开的。

Thus, for you to reach your highest level of mastery and personal calling, you do so by taking your Unique Ability seriously and fully developing and expressing it. You develop your Unique Ability by: 因此，为了达到最高水平的掌握和个人召唤，你必须认真对待你的独特能力，充分发展和表达它。你可以通过以下方式发展你的独特能力：

1.  Being increasingly honest with yourself and other people about what you most want for yourself and your life. Don’t justify your wants to anyone. No one else is you. No one else wants what you want. No one else has your Unique Ability and your unique vision and desires. 对自己和他人越来越诚实，告诉你自己和你的生活最想要的是什么。不要向任何人证明你的愿望。没有别人是你。没有人想要你想要的。没有其他人拥有你独特的能力和你独特的愿景和愿望。
2.  Expanding your vision and thinking exponentially bigger for yourself about what you can be, do, and have. Continually hone your Unique Ability—that which excites you, energizes you, and which you see potential for never-ending improvement—and utilize your Unique Ability to bring forth your 10x vision. Become increasingly clear on who you are and what makes you unique and different from everyone else on this planet. 扩大你的视野，为自己思考你可以成为什么，做什么，拥有什么。不断地磨练你的独特能力--它能让你兴奋，让你充满活力，并且你看到它有无限进步的潜力--并利用你的独特能力来实现你的 10 倍愿景。越来越清楚你是谁，是什么让你与众不同，与这个星球上的其他人不同。
3.  Clarifying your ideal future self and what they would be doing. Be very specific about this. What context are they in? What mission are they fulfilling? What is the cause they are about? What Unique Ability does your future self have, which they are utilizing to dramatically impact and advance what they most care for? What are the unique standards your future self lives by and has normalized, even though they may seem unfathomable and unrealistic to current you? 明确你理想中的未来自己以及他们会做什么。这一点要非常具体。它们处于什么背景下？他们在履行什么使命？他们的原因是什么？你未来的自己有什么独特的能力，他们正在利用这些能力来极大地影响和推进他们最关心的事情？你未来的自己生活的独特标准是什么，即使它们对你来说似乎深不可测，不切实际？
4.  Clarifying the 20 percent that if you develop greater mastery in, you’ll experience your desired 10x jump in freedom of time, money, relationships, and overall purpose. 澄清 20%，如果你更好地掌握，你将体验到你想要的 10 倍跳跃的时间，金钱，关系和整体目标。
5.  Letting go of the 80 percent and allowing yourself to explore your curiosities and interests. 放下 80%，让自己去探索自己的好奇心和兴趣。

Each time you go 10x and transform yourself and your life, you’ll be clearer on your Unique Ability. 每次你改变自己和你的生活 10 倍，你就会更清楚你的独特能力。

For example, I could say, “My Unique Ability is to learn, understand, and distill complex ideas in a compelling, simple, and useful manner.” However, I could be even more specific than this, defining my Unique Ability to position the highly nuanced value I provide to highly specific people. For instance, I could say, “My Unique Ability is to clarify and conceptualize highly complex ideas in the form of compelling, story-driven, and science-based books.” 例如，我可以说：“我的独特能力是以一种引人注目的、简单的和有用的方式学习、理解和提炼复杂的思想。然而，我可以比这更具体，定义我的独特能力，以定位我提供给高度具体的人的高度微妙的价值。例如，我可以说，“我的独特能力是以引人注目的、故事驱动的和以科学为基础的书籍的形式澄清和概念化高度复杂的想法。

A word of warning when it comes to defining your Unique Ability. It’s much, much bigger than anything you specifically do. More directly, your Unique Ability is the unique way you approach what you do when you’re living at your best. It’s not tied to any specific activity, although you can frame it that way strategically and thoughtfully if you’d like. 在定义你的独特能力时，要提醒你一句话。它比你所做的任何事都重要得多。更直接地说，你的独特能力是当你生活在最佳状态时，你处理你所做的事情的独特方式。它与任何特定的活动无关，尽管如果你愿意，你可以战略性地、深思熟虑地将其框架化。

There’s danger in defining your Unique Ability based on a specific skill, such as writing. 10x jumps are often require a great evolution in your Unique Ability, so you want to avoid putting yours in a box. 根据特定的技能来定义你的独特能力是有危险的，比如写作。10 倍跳跃通常需要你独特能力的巨大进化，所以你要避免把你的能力放在一个盒子里。

As decision-making expert Annie Duke stated in her book *Quit*: “When your identity is what you do, then what you do becomes hard to abandon, because it means quitting who you are.”^(23) 正如决策专家安妮·杜克（Annie Duke）在她的书《退出》（Quit）中所说：“当你的身份是你所做的事情时，那么你所做的事情就变得难以放弃，因为这意味着放弃你是谁。 ^(23)

It’s best to chunk your Unique Ability beyond any finite game to the higher and more infinite game—which is beyond context or any specific activity. This is you at your essence, and what you’re ultimately doing beneath any specific activity. In this way, I may define my Unique Ability as, “Connecting with truth, internalizing and being transformed by it, and teaching it in such a way that it transforms those who hear it.” 最好将你的独特能力从任何有限的游戏中分割到更高更无限的游戏中--这是超越上下文或任何特定活动的。这是你的本质，以及你在任何特定活动下最终要做的事情。这样，我可以把我的独特能力定义为：“与真理连接，内化并被它转化，并以这样的方式教导它，它改变了那些听到它的人。

Given that Unique Ability is at the core of who you are and thus highly personal, it requires extreme commitment and courage to connect with, develop, and utilize your Unique Ability. 鉴于独特能力是你的核心，因此高度个人化，它需要极大的承诺和勇气来连接，发展和利用你的独特能力。

If it doesn’t feel like you’re radically exposing yourself, then it’s not Unique Ability. 如果你觉得你没有彻底暴露自己，那就不是独一无二的能力。

If it’s not transforming you rapidly, it’s not Unique Ability. 如果它不能迅速改变你，那就不是特殊能力。

If it doesn’t feel like play and raw creativity, it’s not Unique Ability. 如果感觉不像游戏和原始的创造力，那就不是独一无二的能力。

If the rabbit hole doesn’t go far down, it’s not Unique Ability. 如果兔子洞没有深入到很深的地方，那就不是特殊能力。

If you’re not innovating, breaking rules, and changing boundaries for what “reality” means in a particular discipline or craft, then it’s not Unique Ability. 如果你没有创新，打破规则，改变“现实”在特定学科或工艺中意味着什么，那么这不是独特的能力。

*The scariest and most exciting thing you’ll ever do is be your truest self, holding nothing back, and with no apology.* This is how you develop mastery in your Unique Ability. 你做过的最可怕、最令人兴奋的事情就是做最真实的自己，毫无保留，没有任何歉意。这就是你如何发展你独特能力的掌握。

**What about you? 那你呢？**

*   What is your Unique Ability? 你的独特能力是什么？
*   What is the unique value you provide to others, which no one else can? 你能为他人提供的独特价值是什么，而其他人却无法做到？
*   What is the 10x jump that excites you most, which requires you go all-in on your Unique Ability to realize? 什么是最让你兴奋的 10 倍跳跃，这需要你全力以赴地发挥你的独特能力？
*   What’s the 80 percent of your life keeping you busy but unproductive, because it’s keeping you outside your Unique Ability? 你生活中 80%的时间让你忙碌但没有效率，因为它让你远离了你的独特能力？

## Create Transformational Relationships Where All Parties Are “The Buyer” 创建所有各方都是“买家”的转型关系

*“The only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them.” “我认识的唯一一个举止得体的人就是我的裁缝;他每次见到我都要重新测量我的尺寸。其余的人继续他们的旧尺寸，并期待我适合他们。*

**— GEORGE BERNARD SHAW - 乔治·伯纳德·肖**

When P-Rod was offered the initial sponsorship with Nike, he knew what he wanted. He wanted to have a signature pro-model shoe as part of the deal. 当 P-Rod 得到耐克的最初赞助时，他知道自己想要什么。他想买一双标志性的专业模特鞋作为交易的一部分。

Even though getting a highly lucrative opportunity with Nike was a life-changing opportunity, if P-Rod didn’t get that signature shoe as part of the deal, *he was happy to walk away.* 尽管获得耐克的利润丰厚的机会是一个改变生活的机会，但如果 P-Rod 没有得到这双签名鞋作为交易的一部分，他很乐意离开。

P-Rod knew what he wanted. P-Rod 知道他想要什么。

He wasn’t desperate. 他并不绝望。

He was operating out of want, not need. 他是因为需要而不是需要。

He was clear on the standards he held for himself, which *he* himself chose, irrespective of what anyone else thought or suggested. 他很清楚他为自己所持的标准，他自己选择的标准，不管别人怎么想或建议。

Because P-Rod’s Unique Ability as a skateboarder and artist was becoming so valuable, he was confident calling the shots in his life. He had that confidence. He knew what he brought to the equation. He knew what he could do. He knew there was no competition. 因为 P-Rod 作为滑板运动员和艺术家的独特能力变得如此宝贵，他有信心在他的生活中发号施令。他有这种自信。他知道他给等式带来了什么。他知道自己能做什么。他知道没有竞争。

He’d gone 10x multiple times before. 他以前开过 10 倍。

He’d transformed himself and his life again and again—watching his Unique Ability become profound, undeniable, and exciting. 他一次又一次地改变了自己和自己的生活，看着自己的异能变得深奥，不可否认，令人兴奋。

He was playing his own game. 他在玩他自己的游戏。

He was playing the infinite game. 他在玩无限游戏。

He was free. 他是自由的。

He continually applied the 10x process to transform his life, evolve his Unique Ability, and expand his freedom. As a result, he could be increasingly “choosey” and selective about what worked for him and what didn’t. He wasn’t desperate to be in any partnerships or relationships, because he understood the value of his Unique Ability and he was operating based on want, not need. 他不断地应用 10 倍的过程来改变他的生活，发展他的独特能力，扩大他的自由。因此，他可能会越来越“挑剔”，对什么对他有用，什么对他不有用。他并不急于建立任何合作关系，因为他明白自己异能的价值，他是基于想要而不是需要。

This takes us one level further into Dan Sullivan’s strategic mindsets, which he teaches only the highest level of entrepreneurs. This next concept is one Dan calls Always Be the Buyer.^(24) There is a fundamental and crucial distinction between what Dan calls a “Buyer” or a “Seller.” 这让我们更深入地了解丹·沙利文的战略思维，他只教授最高层次的企业家。下一个概念是丹称之为“永远做买家”的概念。丹称之为“买方”和“卖方”之间有一个根本而关键的区别。

Being the *Buyer* means you have clear standards for yourself, and you know what you want. The opposite is being a *Seller,* where you’re desperate to be in a particular situation because you think you *need it*. 成为买家意味着你对自己有明确的标准，你知道你想要什么。相反的是作为一个卖家，你绝望地处于一个特定的情况，因为你认为你需要它。

As the Seller, you’ll twist yourself into uncomfortable shapes to be accepted. You’re unclear on and uncommitted to your intrinsically crafted standards. You continually lower or change your standards to “get the sale.” 作为卖家，你会把自己扭曲成不舒服的形状来被接受。你不清楚也不遵守你内在制定的标准。你不断地降低或改变你的标准来“获得销售”。

In every social situation, you’re either being a Buyer or a Seller. 在任何社交场合，你要么是买家，要么是卖家。

The difference between a Buyer and a Seller is *the Buyer can walk away.* 买方和卖方的区别在于买方可以离开。

The Buyer is not desperate to be there. 买家并不急于在那里。

The Buyer is the one who does the rejecting, whereas the Seller is the one who gets rejected. “买者是拒绝者，卖者是拒绝者。

P-Rod was totally willing to walk away from Nike if he didn’t get exactly what he wanted. P-Rod 完全愿意离开耐克，如果他没有得到他想要的东西。

P-Rod was the Buyer. P-Rod 是买家。

Together, he and Nike formed a *transformational relationship* and collaboration that has now spanned 17 years, 10 signature shoes, and millions of sold pairs. Together, both P-Rod and Nike have innovated and evolved many times, expanding far beyond what they initially considered or planned when the partnership was formed. 他和耐克一起建立了一种跨越 17 年的转型关系和合作关系，10 双签名鞋和数百万双售出。P-Rod 和 Nike 一起进行了多次创新和发展，其扩张远远超出了他们最初的设想或计划。

The only reason they’ve continued to evolve and expand so much is because P-Rod was the Buyer. Had he been the Seller, he would have lost his confidence and conviction toward what he most wanted. This would have impacted everything he did, even his skating. Since how you do anything is how you do everything. 他们继续发展和扩张这么多的唯一原因是因为 P-Rod 是买家。如果他是卖方，他会失去对他最想要的东西的信心和信念。这会影响他所做的一切，甚至他的滑冰。因为你做任何事的方式就是你做任何事的方式。

Once you allow yourself to be the Seller, then you’re selling yourself short. You’re letting some finite game define who you are and what you can do. You’re being externally, not internally, driven. You’re operating based on perceived need, not want. 一旦你允许自己成为卖家，那么你就是在卖空自己。你让一些有限的博弈来定义你是谁和你能做什么。你是被外在的而不是内在的驱使。你是基于感知的需求而不是欲望。

To go 10x, you must be the Buyer. 如果你是 10 x，你必须是买家。

Then, as the Buyer, you form transformational collaborations with other Buyers—wherein the whole becomes infinitely different and better than the sum of all parts. 然后，作为买方，你与其他买方形成变革性的合作--在那里，整体变得无限不同，比所有部分的总和更好。

As Dan Sullivan explains: 正如 Dan Sullivan 所解释的：

“When you have a *buyer mindset*, you continually use your best learning from all of your experiences to create standards about what will be useful to your future and what won’t be. You always want to be upgrading your present based on the best standards you’ve created. There are always a lot of possibilities, and you have a bigger and better future plan, and that’s why you have to use the standards you’ve built to determine the best opportunities, including who will be useful for you to collaborate with. Potential collaborators have to be resonant with where you’ve determined you’re going and with how you’re developing yourself out of higher levels of capability. Your bigger commitments are going to require courage, and while you’re going through a stage that requires courage, you’ll want to be in relationships with people who are also committed and in a courage stage—people who are always growing.”^(25) “当你有一个购买者的心态时，你会不断地利用你从所有经验中学到的最好的东西来制定标准，确定哪些东西对你的未来有用，哪些东西对你的未来不会有用。你总是希望根据你创造的最佳标准来升级你的礼物。总有很多可能性，你有一个更大更好的未来计划，这就是为什么你必须使用你已经建立的标准来确定最佳机会，包括谁将对你有用的合作。潜在的合作者必须对你决定要去的地方以及你如何在更高水平的能力下发展自己产生共鸣。你更大的承诺需要勇气，当你正在经历一个需要勇气的阶段时，你会希望与那些同样承诺并处于勇气阶段的人建立关系，这些人总是在成长。 ^(25)

In transformational relationships where everyone is the Buyer, payoffs are not necessarily equal for all parties, but the payoffs are uniquely exciting and 10x *from the perspective* of each person involved. 在每个人都是买方的转型关系中，所有各方的收益不一定相等，但从每个参与者的角度来看，收益是独一无二的，是 10 倍。

These types of relationships are “compelling offers” for all parties involved. 这些类型的关系对所有相关方来说都是“令人信服的提议”。

If being in the relationship isn’t a compelling offer, one that offers 10x transformation and growth, then it’s a no-go for a Buyer. 如果在关系中不是一个令人信服的提议，一个提供 10 倍转型和增长的提议，那么这是一个不去的买家。

All participants bring different and unique value to the table. They are positioned differently and ultimately want different things from the collaboration. Trying to make the payoffs equal or “fair” is a transactional approach and fails to appreciate the uniqueness of each participant’s individual context, vision, and desires. 所有参与者都为餐桌带来了不同和独特的价值。他们的定位不同，最终希望从合作中获得不同的东西。试图使收益相等或“公平”是一种交易方法，无法理解每个参与者的个人背景、愿景和愿望的独特性。

You know a relationship is transformational when neither party feels they are losing, and neither party feels they are getting the “upper hand” in the deal. 你知道，当双方都不觉得自己正在失败，也没有一方觉得自己在交易中占了“上风”时，一段关系就是变革性的。

When someone feels they are “losing,” they’re being a Seller. 当有人觉得自己在“失去”时，他们就是卖家。

In transformational relationships, *there are no losers*. Everyone wins in the ways they want, and no justification is required for what each party wants. 在转型关系中，没有失败者。每个人都以自己想要的方式获胜，每一方想要什么都不需要任何理由。

In these types of relationships, everyone wins *if the relationship continues* transforming from 10x jump to 10x jump. Everyone loses *if the relationship ends* because one or both parties shift from 10x to 2x. When momentum shifts to keeping things status quo, 10x transformation halts. 在这些类型的关系中，如果关系继续从 10 倍跳跃到 10 倍跳跃，每个人都赢。如果一方或双方从 10 倍变为 2 倍，关系结束，每个人都输了。当动力转向保持现状时，10 倍的转变就停止了。

To requote Dr. James Carse in *Finite and Infinite Games*: 重新授予 Dr. James Carse《Finite and Infinite Games》

“A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play. . . Finite players play *within* boundaries; infinite players *play with* boundaries. . . Only that which can change can continue.”²⁶ “一个有限的博弈是为了获胜，一个无限的博弈是为了继续比赛。. .有限的玩家在边界内游戏;无限的玩家都有界限。. .只有能够改变的，才能继续”。 ²⁶

When you’re in a finite game, you’re *playing* the game. 当你在一个有限博弈中时，你就是在玩这个博弈。

When you’re in the infinite game, you’re continuously *changing* the game. 当你在无限博弈中时，你在不断地改变着这个博弈。

Being an infinite-player means you’re striving to *continue playing* and transforming the game. 作为一个无限玩家意味着你正在努力继续玩和改变游戏。

Only that which can *continue* can compound and grow exponentially. 只有那些能够继续下去的东西才能复合并呈指数级增长。

Only that which can *change* can continue. 只有能够改变的东西才能继续。

Only that which *effectively adapts* can successfully evolve and not be filtered-out. 只有那些有效适应的东西才能成功地进化，而不会被过滤掉。

Evolution and compounding go hand-in-hand. 进化和复合是齐头并进的。

If something comes to an end, then so do the compounding effects. The only way for something to continue, and thus experience compounding and transformational results, is by effectively evolving. 如果某件事结束了，那么复合效应也会结束。要想让某事物继续下去，从而体验复合和变革的结果，唯一的方法就是有效地进化。

If something stops evolving, it will eventually stop compounding. 如果某个事物停止进化，它最终将停止复合。

As Naval Ravikant said, “Play long-term games with long-term people. All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.”²⁷ 正如海军 Ravikant 所说：“与长期的人玩长期的游戏。生活中的所有回报，无论是财富、人际关系还是知识，都来自复利。 ²⁷

This is why the infinite game is so crucial. 这就是为什么无限博弈如此重要。

Infinite players are continually transforming and elevating themselves and their Unique Ability based on want, not need. They then form 10x or 100x synergistic and compounding relationships that transform and elevate all parties in desired ways. 无限的玩家不断地改变和提升自己和他们的独特能力，基于想要，而不是需要。然后，他们形成 10 倍或 100 倍的协同和复合关系，以期望的方式改造和提升所有各方。

## Chapter Takeaways 第四章要点

*   Society trains people to believe freedom and creativity are scarce resources to compete for. This is not true because money is a finite resource, while wealth is an infinite resource. 社会训练人们相信自由和创造力是稀缺的资源来竞争。这是不正确的，因为金钱是有限的资源，而财富是无限的资源。
*   When you choose freedom over security, then you embrace a life where you choose exactly what you want, rather than vying for what you think you need. 当你选择自由而不是安全时，你就拥抱了一种你完全选择你想要的东西的生活，而不是为你认为你需要的东西而竞争。
*   Living a life based on intrinsic wants enables an abundance mindset that allows you to create the wealth and life you want, without needing to justify to anyone why you want what you want. 基于内在需求的生活可以让你拥有富足的心态，让你创造你想要的财富和生活，而不需要向任何人证明你为什么想要你想要的东西。
*   Living a life based on external needs enables a scarcity mindset that causes you to compete for the limited resources you believe you need. People who live based on need feel they have to justify their actions so that others will accept them. 过一种基于外部需求的生活，会让你产生一种稀缺心态，让你去争夺你认为自己需要的有限资源。以需要为基础生活的人觉得他们必须为自己的行为辩护，这样别人才会接受他们。
*   You must make a choice here and now: Will you continue living in the “needing” world where you must compete for scarce resources and justify everything you do, or will you embrace the “wanting” world where you freely choose, create, and get what you want? 你必须在此时此地做出选择：你会继续生活在“需要”的世界里，在那里你必须竞争稀缺的资源，并为你所做的一切辩护，还是你会拥抱“想要”的世界，在那里你自由地选择、创造和得到你想要的东西？
*   You can only go 10x by embracing a purely wanting approach to life, because 10x isn’t inherently something anyone needs, but only something you can have if you choose the freedom to want and create it. 你只能通过拥抱纯粹想要的生活方式来达到 10 倍，因为 10 倍并不是任何人都需要的东西，而只有当你选择想要和创造它的自由时，你才能拥有。
*   Your Unique Ability is a central and core aspect of who you are, which can only be uncovered and developed by embracing what you most want. 你的独特能力是你是谁的核心和核心方面，只有通过拥抱你最想要的东西才能发现和发展。
*   Your Unique Ability is the way in which you provide the most value for other people, which no one else could ever replicate even if they wanted to. 你的独特能力是你为他人提供最大价值的方式，这是任何人都无法复制的，即使他们想复制。
*   Your Unique Ability is more valuable and exciting than any specific industry or skill, though it can be utilized effectively toward specific activities such as teaching, leading, strategizing, etc. Overly linking your Unique Ability to any single activity, such as teaching, will inhibit your ability to evolve both yourself and your Unique Ability to higher levels. Your Unique Ability is what drives your best and most exciting performance. 你的独特能力比任何特定的行业或技能都更有价值和令人兴奋，尽管它可以有效地用于特定的活动，如教学，领导，制定战略等。将你的独特能力与任何一项活动（如教学）过度联系起来，会抑制你自己和独特能力向更高层次发展的能力。你的独特能力是驱动你最好和最令人兴奋的表现。
*   Being in a flow state occurs when you embrace your Unique Ability because you’re not overly editing yourself based on external approval, attachment to outcomes, etc. Instead, you’re just purely free to be and do and create as you want and in the way you want. You’re completely free and energized as a result and the byproduct is inspired creativity. This is also why and how you transform and expand your Unique Ability to otherworldly levels, wherein you become uniquely skilled and *masterful* at what you do. 当你拥抱你的独特能力时，你就会处于心流状态，因为你不会根据外界的认可、对结果的依恋等过度编辑自己。相反，你只是纯粹的自由，以你想要的方式去做和创造。结果是你完全的自由和精力充沛，副产品是激发创造力。这也是为什么以及如何转变和扩展你的独特能力到超凡脱俗的层次，在那里你变得独特的技能和精通你所做的。
*   To become a true master at what you do, you can’t merely be an expert at something. Expertise is the ability to do something well. *Mastery* is the ability to do something *uniquely well*. A master is someone who can never be replicated, they can only be learned from. Embracing your Unique Ability is how you develop Mastery as a person, and become the highest and most genuine version of yourself. 要想成为你所做的事情真正的大师，你不能仅仅是某件事的专家。专业知识是把事情做好的能力。精通是把某件事做得特别好的能力。大师是一个永远无法复制的人，他们只能向他们学习。拥抱你的独特能力是你如何发展作为一个人的掌握，并成为最高和最真实的自己。
*   When you embrace and take your Unique Ability seriously, you immediately remove yourself from ever competing with anyone again. You appreciate the truth that you and everyone else are unique individuals who can never be replicated. Rather than trying to be like other people, your objective becomes to peel away the layers impeding you from being the most expansive and evolved version of yourself—the “David.” 当你接受并认真对待你的独特能力时，你会立刻让自己不再与任何人竞争。你欣赏这样一个事实：你和其他人都是独一无二的个体，永远无法复制。你的目标不是试图像其他人一样，而是剥离那些阻碍你成为最广阔、最进化的你自己的层面--“大卫”
*   Your Unique Ability is never a finished product and evolves dramatically with each 10x jump you make. 你的独特能力永远不会是成品，它会随着你每跳 10 倍而急剧发展。
*   Letting go of the 80 percent and fully embracing the 20 percent that most excites (and most scares) you will take you much closer to your Unique Ability. 放弃 80%，完全拥抱 20%最令人兴奋（也最令人恐惧），你会更接近你的独特能力。
*   As you develop your Unique Ability to profound levels, you’ll have increased freedom to dictate the situations and opportunities in your life. Rather than desperately being in situations you don’t truly want, you only embrace the situations and opportunities where your Unique Ability *is valued*, but also, where your Unique Ability *can be most transformed and expanded*. 当你将你的独特能力发展到更深层次时，你将拥有更多的自由来支配生活中的情况和机会。而不是绝望地陷入你并不真正想要的情况中，你只拥抱你的独特能力被重视的情况和机会，而且，你的独特能力可以被最大程度地转化和扩展。
