# CHAPTER 4 第四章

# UNCOVER YOUR 10x PAST TO CLARIFY YOUR 10x FUTURE 揭开您的 10 倍过去，阐明您的 10 倍未来

You’ve Done It Before and You’ll Do It Again 你以前做过，你还会再做一次

◆ ◆ ◆

*“You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. So, you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path.” “你不能向前看连接点，你只能向后看连接它们。所以，你必须相信这些点会在你的未来以某种方式连接起来。你必须相信一些东西：你的直觉命运生活因果报应什么的因为相信这条路上的点点滴滴会连接起来，会给予你信心去追随自己的心，即使它会让你偏离老路。*

**— STEVE JOBS^(1) - 史蒂夫工作 ^(1)**

While writing this book, I asked my friends, family, and clients to read the early drafts. 在写这本书的时候，我让我的朋友、家人和客户阅读了早期的草稿。

One friend, a relatively small entrepreneur, mentor, and dear friend of mine, told me that he loved the concepts but ultimately, he didn’t believe the book was for him. “I’m not looking for the level of transformation and commitment you’re describing in this book, Ben. I guess I prefer 2x over 10x as a way of life.” 一个朋友，一个相对较小的企业家，导师，我的好朋友，告诉我，他喜欢的概念，但最终，他不相信这本书是为他。“我不是在寻找你在这本书中描述的转变和承诺的水平，本。我想我更喜欢 2x 而不是 10x 作为一种生活方式。

I saluted this dear friend of mine, agreeing that this book is *not for everyone*. And that’s completely fine. 10x as a way of life may not be for you. If you’ve made it this far into this book, you’re probably clear whether 10x is for you. 我向我的这位亲爱的朋友致敬，同意这本书不适合所有人。完全没关系。10x 作为一种生活方式可能不适合你。如果你已经读到了这本书，你可能很清楚 10x 是否适合你。

Or maybe you’re still on the fence. 或者你还在犹豫。

If the idea of 10x perplexes or discourages you, continue reading. This chapter will help. 如果 10 倍的想法让你困惑或沮丧，请继续阅读。这一章将有所帮助。

Another one of my friends who read the first 100 pages while the book was still a rough draft was both inspired and frustrated by what he read. It’s not that he disagreed with the premise. On the contrary, he said the concept of 10x was actually incredibly clear and simple. 我的另一个朋友在书还是草稿的时候读了前 100 页，他读到的东西既鼓舞又沮丧。这并不是说他不同意这个前提。相反，他说 10 倍的概念实际上是令人难以置信的清晰和简单。

The concept frustrated him because he realized he wanted to live a 10x life—but to do so, he’d need to make some serious changes. He’d need to completely alter the trajectory of his career. 这个概念让他很沮丧，因为他意识到他想要过 10 倍的生活，但要做到这一点，他需要做出一些重大的改变。他需要彻底改变他的职业生涯轨迹。

Here’s what he said when I asked what he thought of the book: 当我问他对这本书的看法时，他是这样说的：

“I come at it from two different places: my personal life and my career. For me personally, the concept of 10x is inspiring and I feel like something I could really get behind to improve my life and my relationships. I particularly appreciate how you frame it as qualitative rather than quantitative. It’s not about the numbers but how you fundamentally transform. But from the view of a middle manager at a Fortune 500, publicly traded company, I can’t help but be completely frustrated. Not by your writing or the 10x concept itself, but from the complete impracticality of actually trying to implement it from where I sit. There are so many layers of bureaucracy that make change in a large organization so difficult. So really what I take from reading those first 100 pages is another nudging that I need to make a career shift. I just haven’t been able to figure out what I would like to shift to. Coming full circle, I need to better define what I want.” “我从两个不同的地方来的：我的私生活和事业对我个人来说，10 倍的概念是鼓舞人心的，我觉得我可以真正得到背后的东西，以改善我的生活和我的关系。我特别欣赏你如何把它定义为定性而不是定量。关键不是数字，而是你如何从根本上转变。但从一家财富 500 强上市公司的中层经理的角度来看，我不禁感到非常沮丧。不是你的写作或 10 倍的概念本身，而是从我坐的地方实际上试图实现它的完全不切实际。官僚主义的层层递进使得一个大型组织的变革变得如此困难。所以，我从阅读前 100 页中得到的东西是另一个推动，我需要进行职业转变。我只是不知道我想转向什么。在整个循环中，我需要更好地定义我想要的是什么。“

To be clear, this book was written with *high-level entrepreneurs* in mind, who not only have a great deal of freedom in their lives but also who continually seek and create greater freedom in their lives and trajectories. 需要明确的是，这本书是以高级企业家为对象写的，他们不仅在生活中拥有大量的自由，而且在生活和轨迹中不断寻求和创造更大的自由。

10x is fundamentally about freedom. 10x 基本上是关于自由的。

The freedom to be, live, and create what you want and how you want. 自由的生活，生活，创造你想要的和你想要的。

Freedom obviously isn’t free. It requires extreme self-honesty, commitment, and courage. It requires peeling away the layers of fear and attachment that would keep you 2x and living a life based on need, not want. It takes owning the consequences of your wins and losses, as well as the consequences of not being understood by many of those around you. 自由显然不是免费的。它需要极度的自我诚实、承诺和勇气。它需要剥离的恐惧和依恋层会让你保持 2 倍，并生活在需要的基础上，而不是欲望。它需要拥有你的胜利和失败的后果，以及不被你周围的许多人理解的后果。

Therefore, my friend, who is not an entrepreneur, isn’t the directly intended audience of this book. That said, my response to him is the same as if I was talking to a high-level entrepreneur: *Wherever you are now, going 10x from here will require a total remodeling of both yourself and your business.* 因此，我这位不是企业家的朋友并不是本书的直接读者。话虽如此，我对他的回答就像是在和一位高级企业家交谈一样：无论你现在在哪里，从这里走 10 倍将需要你自己和你的企业的全面重塑。

You can’t go 10x with the same model you have now. This includes not only your business and strategic model but also your mental models and identity as well. 你不能用你现在的模型去 10 倍。这不仅包括你的业务和战略模型，还包括你的心理模型和身份认同。

Going 10x will transform everything in your life if you fully embrace it. 如果你完全接受 10 倍，你生活中的一切都会改变。

If you want to 10x, you have to radically change 80 percent of your life. This is a scary thought. 如果你想要 10 倍，你必须彻底改变你生活的 80%。这是一个可怕的想法。

How could you mentally survive such a sacrifice? 你怎么能在精神上活下来这样的牺牲？

In our book *The Gap and The Gain*, Dan Sullivan and I present a counterintuitive mindset shift that makes letting go of your 80 percent not only possible, but fun. 在我们的《差距与增益》一书中，丹·沙利文和我提出了一种反直觉的思维转变，这种转变让你放弃 80%不仅可能，而且很有趣。

If you stay stuck in what Dan calls “the gap,” 10x won’t be an enjoyable experience for you. 10x will actually be detrimental to your mental and physical well-being, as well as all of your relationships, if you say in the gap. 如果你停留在丹所谓的“差距”中，10 倍对你来说不会是一个愉快的经历。10 倍实际上对你的精神和身体健康有害，以及你所有的关系，如果你说在差距。

You may be able to go 10x a time or two while in the gap. But frankly, you’ll be a shell of who you could have become, because the gap keeps you living for external rewards, rather than your intrinsic desires. It keeps you chasing, not living. It keeps you feeling awful about yourself, not confident and with momentum. 你可以一次或两次在差距中去 10 倍。但坦率地说，你将成为一个你本来可以成为的人的外壳，因为差距让你活着是为了外在的回报，而不是你内在的欲望。它让你追逐，而不是生活。它让你对自己感觉很糟糕，没有自信和动力。

Only by learning to live and embrace “the gain” will 10x become a truly enjoyable and ongoing journey for you. But not only that, by being in the gain, you’ll also take far more from *every experience* you have in life—the good, bad, and ugly. You’ll learn to take every experience and *turn it to your gain* such that you’re constantly and quickly getter *better and wiser*, and never plateauing. 只有学会生活和拥抱“收获”，10 倍才能成为你真正愉快和持续的旅程。但不仅如此，通过获得好处，你也会从生活中的每一个经历中获得更多好处，无论是好的，坏的，还是丑的。你将学会接受每一次经验，并将其转化为你的收获，这样你就能不断地、迅速地变得更好、更聪明，永远不会停滞不前。

After helping you more fully understand the difference between the gap and the gain, and why being in the gain is vital for living a 10x life, this chapter will help you recontextualize your past from a gain perspective. Specifically, you’ll learn a simple technique for better seeing and appreciating the 10x jumps *you’ve already made* as a person and entrepreneur to get where you are now. 在帮助你更全面地理解差距和收获之间的区别，以及为什么在收获中对过上 10 倍的生活至关重要之后，本章将帮助你从收获的角度重新审视你的过去。具体来说，你将学习一个简单的技巧，更好地看到和欣赏你作为一个人和企业家已经做的 10 倍跳跃，以达到你现在的位置。

After helping you frame your previous 10x jumps, we will then dive into two powerful models that will help you clarify, in extreme specificity and excitement, the next 10x jumps you want to make. By clarifying your next 10x jumps, you’ll also clarify where you want to more fully develop and transform your Unique Ability. 在帮助您构建之前的 10 倍跳跃之后，我们将深入研究两个强大的模型，以极端的具体性和兴奋性帮助您澄清您想要进行的下一次 10 倍跳跃。通过澄清你接下来的 10 倍跳跃，你也将澄清你想要更充分地发展和转变你的独特能力。

Let’s begin. 我们开始吧.

## The Gap and The Gain 差距与增益

*“Your level of capability in the future depends upon your measurement of achievements in the past. You can’t move forward and grow until you’ve acknowledged how far you’ve come and have properly measured your gains.” “你未来的能力水平取决于你对过去成就的衡量。你不能前进和成长，直到你承认你已经走了多远，并正确地衡量你的收获。*

**— DAN SULLIVAN^(2) - DAN SULIVAN ^(2)**

While leading a Strategic Coach workshop over 25 years ago—in the mid 1990s—Dan Sullivan made an important realization. He noticed that despite having objectively achieved a lot over the previous 3–12 months, many of his entrepreneurial clients *de-valued* that progress. Said another way, they were dissatisfied and even emotionally negative toward what they’d accomplished. 在 25 年前--20 世纪 90 年代中期--领导战略教练研讨会时，丹·沙利文取得了重要的成就。他注意到，尽管他在过去的 3-12 个月客观上取得了很大的成就，但他的许多创业客户都低估了这一进步。换句话说，他们对自己所取得的成就感到不满，甚至情绪上消极。

One client in particular was so negative that Dan came up with a model that became *The Gap and The Gain*. Dan was asking the group of entrepreneurs to reflect on and discuss the progress they’d made personally and as a business the previous 90 days, since their last workshop. 特别是有一个客户非常消极，丹想出了一个模型，成为了差距和增益。丹要求这群企业家反思和讨论自上次研讨会以来的 90 天里，他们个人和企业所取得的进展。

This client was insistent that *absolutely nothing* positive had occurred since they’d last met. 这位客户坚持说，自从他们上次见面以来，绝对没有任何积极的事情发生。

“Nothing?” Dan asked. “没什么？”丹问。

“Yes, absolutely nothing,” the man replied. “是的，绝对没有，”那人回答。

“Well didn’t you say you’d gotten a new client, and that your team was working on some important projects?” “嗯，你不是说你有了一个新客户，你的团队正在做一些重要的项目吗？“

“Yes, but that stuff doesn’t matter because we missed a lot of opportunities we should have had. We should be a lot further along than we are now.” “是的，但这些并不重要，因为我们错过了很多我们应该有的机会。我们应该比现在沿着。”

This man was in the gap. 这个人在差距中。

The gap is a lens by which you measure *what is* against what *could be*. In the gap, you’re measuring what is against what you believe *should be*. 差距是一个透镜，你通过它来衡量什么是可能的。在差距中，你在衡量什么是你认为应该是什么。

*When you’re in the gap, you’re measuring yourself or your situation against an ideal*. 当你处于差距时，你是在用一个理想来衡量你自己或你的处境。

This happens so much that it’s the conventional mode of operating for most people. Take for example, my children, who come to the dinner table when it’s time to eat. Sometimes they’ll get to the table and let out a huge sigh of disappointment that dinner isn’t something else. 这种情况发生得太多了，以至于这是大多数人的常规操作模式。以我的孩子为例，他们在吃饭的时候来到餐桌前。有时他们会走到餐桌前，失望地叹了口气，因为晚餐不是别的东西。

Rather than appreciating the meal mom worked hard to make, and the fact that they have a nice home, a nice family, and a warm dinner to eat, they *devalue the whole experience* because they’re measuring it against some arbitrary ideal in their mind. 而不是欣赏妈妈辛苦做的饭菜，事实上他们有一个美好的家，一个美好的家庭，和一顿温暖的晚餐吃，他们贬低了整个经历，因为他们正在衡量它与一些主观的理想在他们心中。

Now, let me be really clear, because this is a highly nuanced yet simple idea, which can be easily misunderstood. 现在，让我说清楚，因为这是一个高度微妙但简单的想法，很容易被误解。

Being in *the gain*—which we will go into more in a moment—isn’t simply about being grateful for what you have and where you are. Despite not *being* gratitude, being in the gain does trigger an enormous amount of gratitude among other things, including confidence, wisdom, inspiration, and excitement. 我们稍后会详细介绍获得收益并不仅仅是对你所拥有的和你所处的位置心怀感激。尽管没有感恩之心，但在收获中确实引发了巨大的感恩之情，包括信心、智慧、灵感和兴奋。

The gap and the gain aren’t about gratitude or lack of gratitude. 差距和收获并不在于感恩或缺乏感恩。

Being in either the gap or the gain is purely about *how you’re measuring* yourself and your experiences. I’ll detail the effects of measuring yourself in the gap first, then explain the positively transformative effects of measuring yourself (and everything else) in the gain. 处于差距或收获纯粹是关于你如何衡量自己和你的经验。我将首先详细说明在差距中衡量自己的效果，然后解释在增益中衡量自己（以及其他一切）的积极变革效果。

Dan’s client was measuring himself, his life, his wife, and his business against an ideal in his mind. He was upset and frustrated that he wasn’t where he thought he *should be*. By measuring himself against his ideal, not only was he devaluing where he currently was, but he was also devaluing his entire past. 丹的客户正在衡量他自己，他的生活，他的妻子，他的生意在他心中的理想。他感到沮丧和沮丧，因为他没有在他认为他应该在的地方。用自己的理想来衡量自己，他不仅贬低了自己现在所处的位置，也贬低了自己的整个过去。

When you’re in the gap, then your past becomes a problem. It becomes a nightmare because your past isn’t what it *should have been.* 当你处于差距时，你的过去就成了问题。它变成了一场噩梦，因为你的过去不是它应该是的。

*You’re* not where you “should” be as a person. 你不是你作为一个人“应该”的地方。

Having a problematic past doesn’t support creating a bigger future. On the contrary, having negative energy, emotions, and created meaning about your past only perpetuates the fact that your future won’t be any different. 拥有一个有问题的过去并不支持创造一个更大的未来。相反，消极的能量、情绪和对你过去的创造意义只会使你的未来不会有任何不同的事实永久化。

Not surprisingly, this client’s gap mindset ended up corroding and destroying everything he claimed mattered to him, leading to his inevitable divorce and loss of ambition. Eventually, chasing ideals stops being fun when you’ve made it your habit to measure yourself against them, feeling the burden again and again (and again. . .) of never being enough. 毫不奇怪，这位客户的差距心态最终腐蚀和摧毁了他声称对他重要的一切，导致他不可避免地离婚和失去抱负。最终，当你习惯于用理想来衡量自己，一次又一次地感受到负担时，追求理想就不再有趣了。. .）永远都不够

When my children were upset about the dinner on the table, they were *measuring their experience* against an ideal in their mind. As a result, they not only devalued the benefit they’d just received, but they were also worse-off emotionally for having gotten dinner. 当我的孩子们为桌上的晚餐感到不安时，他们正在用心中的理想来衡量自己的经历。这样一来，他们不仅贬低了刚刚得到的好处，还因为吃了晚饭，情绪也变得更差了。

That’s the disturbing part of being in the gap. You’ve technically made progress but you feel worse as a result, because of the framing you’ve placed on that progress—measuring it against what it *should be.* 这就是差距中令人不安的地方。你在技术上已经取得了进步，但结果你感觉更糟，因为你在进步上设置了框架--与它应该是什么来衡量它。

You can be in the gap about *anything*, and usually people who tend to be in the gap are in the gap *a lot*. Perhaps the most destructive form the gap can take is when you’re in the gap about other people, wherein you only see where those who support you—like your employees—are not *measuring up*. 你可以在任何事情上处于差距中，通常倾向于处于差距中的人经常处于差距中。也许最具破坏性的差距是当你和其他人有差距时，你只看到那些支持你的人，比如你的员工，没有达到标准。

While writing *The Gap and The Gain*, this point particularly hit me hard. I’m a father of six kids and I realized how often I’m in the gap about my kids, especially the ones we adopted a few years back through the foster system. When I’m in the gap about my kids, I’m measuring them against ideals for where I think they should be. Most sadly, though, when I’m in the gap about my kids, I’m not seeing all the ways they’ve actually grown and progressed—either short-term or long-term—which are substantial. 在写《差距与增益》的时候，这一点对我的打击特别大。我是六个孩子的父亲，我意识到我经常对我的孩子有差距，特别是几年前我们通过寄养系统收养的孩子。当我对我的孩子们差距时，我会根据我认为他们应该在哪里的理想来衡量他们。然而，最可悲的是，当我对我的孩子们的差距时，我没有看到他们实际上成长和进步的所有方式无论是短期的还是长期的，这些都是实质性的。

By putting my kids in the gap, not only do I devalue them, but I teach them to devalue themselves. I teach them that their success and happiness are an unreachable ideal, which they can forever pursue but will never indeed realize. 把我的孩子们放在差距上，我不仅贬低了他们，而且还教他们贬低自己。我教导他们，成功和幸福是一个遥不可及的理想，他们可以永远追求，但永远不会真正实现。

Measuring yourself against ideals is a losing battle, even for the most positive and idealistic among us. The reason is simple: ideals aren’t stable. They’re constantly changing based on where you’re presently at. 用理想来衡量自己是一场必败的战斗，即使对我们当中最积极和理想主义的人来说也是如此。原因很简单：理想是不稳定的。它们会根据你目前所处的位置不断变化。

*Ideals are like the horizon in the desert. 理想就像沙漠中的地平线。*

No matter how many steps you take toward the horizon, it continues extending out ahead of you. 无论你朝地平线走了多少步，它仍在你面前延伸。

When you’re measuring yourself against ideals, it’s like measuring yourself against the moving horizon and then being mad at yourself for not being at the horizon. 当你用理想来衡量自己的时候，就像用移动的地平线来衡量自己，然后因为自己不在地平线上而生气。

News flash: *You can’t ever reach the horizon.* 新闻快讯：你永远无法到达地平线。

Similarly, you can’t reach your ideals because no matter how far you go, your ideals will always stretch way, way beyond where you’re now at. 同样，你也无法达到你的理想，因为无论你走多远，你的理想总是会延伸到你现在的位置。

This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have ideals. It doesn’t mean ideals aren’t useful. On the contrary, ideals are incredibly useful for providing direction to set spatial and specific goals to progress toward. 这并不意味着你不应该有理想。这并不意味着理想就没用。相反，理想对于提供方向来设定空间和具体的目标是非常有用的。

However, even after you’ve set clear, specific, and measurable goals, it’s still easy to go into the gap. You can go in the gap if you *didn’t* hit the goal, measuring your progress against the target and feeling like a loser for not having “succeeded.” You can also go into the gap if you *did* hit the target, measuring your progress against some different ideal beyond or different from the target itself. 然而，即使在你设定了清晰、具体和可衡量的目标之后，仍然很容易进入差距。如果你没有达到目标，你可以进入差距，衡量你的进步与目标，并感觉自己是一个失败者没有“成功”。如果你确实达到了目标，你也可以进入差距，用超越目标本身或与目标不同的不同理想来衡量你的进步。

Both are destructive. 两者都是破坏性的。

Both are painful. 两者都很痛苦。

Both corrode the joy you could experience by being in the gain. 两者都侵蚀了你可以体验到的喜悦。

Fundamentally, the gap is an *unhealthy need* you’ve placed on something outside of yourself to avoid facing the truth within. 从根本上说，差距是一种不健康的需要，你把自己放在外在的东西上，以避免面对内在的真相。

When you’re in the gap, you think *you need* the ideal—you *need* that new car, *need* that deal, *need* that new client, *need* the weather to be better, that bestseller, etc. etc. etc. 当你处于差距期时，你认为你需要理想--你需要那辆新车，需要那笔交易，需要那新客户，需要天气变好，那本畅销书等等等等等等。

No matter how much you achieve or consume, if you’re in the gap, your endless “needing” won’t go away. It will only get worse. The gap can never be satisfied externally even though you may spend your life chasing that mirage. 无论你取得了多少成就或消费了多少，如果你处于差距中，你无尽的“需求”就不会消失。只会变得更糟。这个差距永远无法从外在得到满足，即使你可能会花一生去追逐那个海市蜃楼。

Take, for example, the actor Matthew Perry who starred as Chandler Bing in the television show *Friends*. In his memoir, *Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing*, Perry describes his lifetime of chasing fame, women, alcohol, and drugs to ultimately fill a gap inside. As he describes: 以演员马修·佩里为例，他在电视节目《老友记》中饰演钱德勒·宾。在他的回忆录《朋友、情人和大可怕的事情》中，佩里描述了他一生追逐名利、女人、酒精和毒品，最终填补内心空白。正如他所描述的：

“I was pretty sure fame would change everything, and I yearned for it more than any other person on the face of the planet. I *needed* it. It was the only thing that would fix me. I was certain of it. . . But the magic never lasts; whatever holes you’re filling seem to keep opening back up. (It’s like Whac-A-Mole.) Maybe it was because I was always trying to fill a spiritual hole with a material thing.”^(3) “我很确定名声会改变一切，我比这个星球上任何其他人都更渴望它。我需要它。这是唯一能治好我的办法。我很确定。. .但魔术永远不会持续;你填补的漏洞似乎一直在重新打开。(It 就像打地鼠一样。）也许是因为我总是试图用物质的东西来填补精神上的空洞。” ^(3)

Being in the gap, like any addiction, is a sickness. Entrepreneurs may experience a lifetime of achievement, yet their self-confidence will decrease with every win. Many successful people who adopt this mindset take extreme measures to numb their pain. 处于差距，就像任何上瘾一样，是一种疾病。创业者可能一生都有成就，但他们的自信心会随着每一次胜利而降低。许多采用这种心态的成功人士采取极端措施来麻木他们的痛苦。

Spoiler alert: *The gain is the antidote.* But we’ll get to that in a second. 剧透警告：收获就是解药。不过，我们一会儿就能讲到这个了。

*If you stay in the gap, going for 10x will be traumatic.* Instead of being motivated by your goals, your goals will burn you out. 如果你停留在差距，去 10 倍将是创伤。而不是被你的目标所激励，你的目标会让你精疲力竭。

Hilariously, many gap-minded entrepreneurs rationalize their mindset, saying it’s *the reason* they’re successful. Because they’re “never satisfied,” they’re always stretching and reaching for more. All the while, they miss the point that they’re missing the point. Usually not until after it’s too late do they realize they paid too heavy a price to continually chase their ideals, missing this moment *right here and right now*. 有趣的是，许多思想分歧的企业家将他们的思维方式合理化，说这是他们成功的原因。因为他们“永远不满足”，他们总是在伸展和达到更多。一直以来，他们都忽略了他们错过的重点。通常直到为时已晚，他们才意识到，他们付出了太多的代价才继续追求自己的理想，错过了此时此刻的此刻。

Does this mean you shouldn’t go for 10x? 这是否意味着你不应该去 10 倍？

Does this mean you should let go of all ambitions and goals? 这是否意味着你应该放弃所有的野心和目标？

Although that’s the knee-jerk reaction and conclusion many come to—that you should just let go of goals, dreams, and 10x altogether—that’s not what being in the gain is about. 尽管这是许多人下意识的反应和结论你应该放弃目标、梦想和 10 倍的全部但这并不是获得胜利的意义。

Letting go of your dreams isn’t the answer. 放弃你的梦想不是解决办法。

Your life will be bleak and purposeless without massive and stretching 10x goals and meanings to fulfill. 你的生活将是暗淡和无目的的，没有巨大的和延伸的 10 倍的目标和意义去实现。

So, then what does it mean to be in the gain? 那么，什么叫在收益中？

And how can you possibly have both—where you’re stretching and transforming toward huge dreams yet fully happy and satisfied with where you now are? 你怎么可能两者兼得呢？你正在向巨大的梦想伸展和转变，同时又对你现在所处的位置感到非常高兴和满意？

Again, it all comes down to how you measure yourself and your experiences. 再一次，这一切都归结于你如何衡量自己和你的经验。

The gap is a reactive and external approach to measuring yourself and your experiences. 差距是一种被动的外部方法来衡量你自己和你的经验。

The gain is a proactive, creative, and internal approach to measuring yourself and your experiences. 收获是一种主动的、创造性的、内部的方法来衡量自己和你的经历。

When you’re in the gain, you’re never measuring yourself against anything external. You’re only measuring yourself against yourself. More directly, you’re measuring yourself against where you were before. 当你在获益时，你永远不会去衡量自己与任何外在的东西。你只是在拿自己来衡量自己。更直接地说，你是在衡量自己和你以前的位置。

While in the gain, you have ideals as well as clear and specific goals you’re stretching toward—*even 10x goals*. But you’re not measuring yourself against those ideals or even against your goals. Instead, you’re *only measuring yourself backward* against where and who you were before. 在收获的同时，你有理想，也有明确而具体的目标，甚至是 10 倍的目标。但你并不是在衡量自己的理想，甚至是你的目标。相反，你只是在回顾自己在哪里和你以前是谁。

As Dan states: 正如 Dan 所说：

“The only way to measure the distance you’ve traveled is by measuring from where you are back to the point where you started, not from where you are toward the horizon.”^(4) “测量你走过的距离的唯一方法是从你现在的位置测量到你开始的位置，而不是从你现在的位置朝向地平线。 ^(4)

By measuring yourself backward, you’re actually seeing and appreciating your progress, which is your own. By seeing and appreciating your progress, you feel enormously better and clearer on who you are and where you’re at. 通过向后衡量自己，你实际上看到并欣赏自己的进步，这是你自己的进步。通过看到和欣赏你的进步，你会感觉更好，更清楚你是谁，你在哪里。

This feeling of confidence and momentum is essential to going 10x. It helps you keep proper perspective of where you’re at and what’s going on. The truth is, you’re making far more progress than it sometimes feels like. Regularly reflecting on, appreciating, and measuring that progress immediately *lightens the weight* of 10x. It boosts you forward on your best and worst days. 这种信心和动力的感觉是 10 倍的关键。它帮助你保持正确的角度，你在哪里和正在发生什么。事实是，你的进步比你有时感觉的要大得多。定期反思、欣赏和衡量这一进步，立即减轻了 10 倍的重量。它会在你最好和最坏的日子里推动你前进。

But there’s something deeper than merely recognizing and measuring your progress regularly. By regularly measuring yourself backward, you begin to view your past differently. You begin to see “wins” and gains you normally wouldn’t consider “progress.” You start to glean more from your experiences, the good and bad. You squeeze more juice out of your experiences because while in the gain, you’re the one defining what your experiences mean. 但是，有一些比仅仅认识和定期衡量你的进步更深刻的东西。通过定期回顾自己，你开始以不同的方式看待自己的过去。你开始看到你通常不会考虑的“进步”和“胜利”。你开始从你的经历中收集更多，好的和坏的。你从你的经历中榨取更多的果汁，因为在获得的同时，你是定义你的经历意味着什么的人。

While in the gap, your experiences are driving you. If things aren’t how you ideally want them to be, then you’re the victim. 当你处于间隙时，你的经历在驱动着你。如果事情不是你理想中想要的那样，那么你就是受害者。

In the gain, you’re antifragile. Everything happens for you, not to you. Every experience has something to offer. Every moment you learn and become better, not bitter as a result. 在收获中，你是反脆弱的。一切都是为了你而不是为了你。每一次经历都有一些东西可以提供。每时每刻你都在学习，变得更好，而不是因为痛苦。

Regularly refencing your own progress also helps you truly embrace your own game in life. You’re not competing with anyone. You’re on your own unique path. You’re having your own unique experiences and converting those experiences into new insights, standards, and growth. 定期反思自己的进步也能帮助你真正拥抱自己的生活。你没有和任何人竞争。你走上了自己独特的道路。你拥有自己独特的体验，并将这些体验转化为新的见解、标准和成长。

Loads of research in psychology and neuroscience backs up Dan’s gain concept. I’ll list just a few: 大量的心理学和神经科学研究支持丹的增益概念。我只列出几个：

*   **Research shows that happiness and positive emotions—especially gratitude—lead to more creative thinking, better decision making, higher performance, and self-determination.**^(5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) Being in the gain radically boosts positive emotions, gratitude, and appreciation. The emotional signature of the gain is *dopamine* (i.e., happiness, motivation, and excitement). The emotional signature of the gap is *cortisol* (i.e., stress and frustration) which hurts performance. 研究表明，快乐和积极的情绪，尤其是感恩，会带来更多的创造性思维，更好的决策，更好的表现和自我决定。 ^(5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) 获得利益会极大地提升积极的情绪、感激和欣赏。增益的情绪特征是多巴胺（即，快乐、动力和兴奋）。差距的情绪特征是皮质醇（即，压力和挫折），这会损害性能。
*   **Research shows that confidence is the byproduct of past successes, more than the cause of future success**.^(13) Being in the gain continually boosts your confidence by allowing you to reference your progress. While in the gap, you don’t and can’t appreciate the progress you’ve already made. You can’t see where you’re now at because you’re referencing yourself against continually adjusting external criteria. Only by measuring backward against a clear starting point can you see not only how you got to where you’re at but also where you’re now at. By clarifying and appreciating your progress, your confidence increases, which boosts your imagination and motivation to see and create more gains. 研究表明，自信是过去成功的副产品，而不是未来成功的原因。 ^(13) 通过让你参考自己的进步，不断获得收益会不断增强你的信心。差距中，你不会也不能欣赏你已经取得的进步。你无法看到你现在的位置，因为你在不断调整外部标准中引用自己。只有在一个明确的起点上向后测量，你才能看到你是如何到达现在的位置的，也能看到你现在的位置。通过澄清和欣赏你的进步，你的信心会增加，这会增强你的想象力和动力去看到和创造更多的收获。
*   **Research shows that highly hopeful and motivated people continually take feedback from not achieving their goals to iterate or adjust their pathway forward**.^(14,15) High-hope people take *every experience* they have as a learning opportunity—no matter the experience. Everything happens *for* them, not *to* them. They utilize every experience to improve how they live and approach life. This is pathways thinking, which is taking every experience you have and using it for learning and iteration. Every experience is a perpetual goldmine filled with more and more lessons. 研究表明，充满希望和积极性的人会不断地从没有实现目标中获得反馈，以迭代或调整他们前进的道路。 ^(14,15) 满怀希望的人把他们的每一次经历都当作学习的机会--不管经历是什么。一切都是为了他们而不是为了他们。他们利用每一个经验来改善他们的生活方式和生活方式。这是路径思维，它是利用你拥有的每一个经验，并将其用于学习和迭代。每一次经历都是一座永远的金矿，里面充满了越来越多的教训。

Practicing a gain mindset is very simple. At the end of each day, you could write down three “wins” you had that day. Those wins could be things you learned (even from things that didn’t go well). They could be literal progress you made toward your goals, even if it was minor progress. It could be experiences you had, such as spending time with your kids. 练习一种收获心态很简单。在每天结束时，你可以写下你当天的三次“胜利”。这些胜利可能是你学到的东西（即使是从不顺利的事情中）。它们可能是你朝着目标所取得的实实在在的进步，即使只是微小的进步。这可能是你的经历，比如花时间和孩子在一起。

Whatever you focus on expands. 无论你专注于什么，都会扩展。

Whatever you see, you create more of. 无论你看到什么，你创造了更多。

By focusing on the gains in your life, you’ll begin to feel like you’re always winning. You’ll begin to see and create more gains from every day and every experience. Consequently, you’ll be able to create more gains from every day. 通过专注于生活中的收获，你会开始感觉你总是在胜利。你将开始从每一天和每一次经历中看到并创造更多的收获。因此，你将能够从每一天中创造更多的收益。

You can measure your gains for all different timeframes. Here are a few questions you could reflect on simply to get yourself into the gain: 你可以衡量你在所有不同的时间范围内的收益。以下是几个问题，你可以思考一下，让自己获得收益：

*   How have you grown as a person over the past three years? 在过去的三年里，你是如何成长的？
*   What are the biggest things you’ve learned in the past 12 months? 在过去的 12 个月里，你学到的最重要的东西是什么？
*   What are 10 important things you’ve accomplished in the past 12 months? 在过去的 12 个月里，你完成的 10 件重要的事情是什么？
*   What meaningful experiences have you had in the past 90 days? 在过去的 90 天里，你有过哪些有意义的经历？
*   How are you clearer on your goals and vision than you were 90 days ago? 你比 90 天前更清楚自己的目标和愿景？
*   In what ways is your life different and better than it was 30 days ago? 你的生活在哪些方面比 30 天前有所不同和更好？
*   What important progress have you made the past seven days? 在过去的七天里，你取得了哪些重要进展？
*   What progress have you made in the past 24 hours? 在过去的 24 小时里，你取得了什么进展？

No matter where you’re currently at in your 10x process, you’re making gains. You’re making more gains than you actually realize. Regularly referencing your gains enables you to see and feel that progress. Taking ownership of your experiences also enables you to transform your experiences into more gains. By learning more from every experience you have, you’ll stop repeating needless errors. You’ll never plateau as a person. 无论您目前处于 10 倍过程中的哪个阶段，您都在取得收益。你的收获比你实际意识到的要多。定期参考你的收获使你能够看到和感受到进步。拥有自己的经验也能让你把经验转化为更多的收获。通过从你的每一个经验中学习更多，你将不再重复不必要的错误。作为一个人，你永远不会稳定下来。

Even if externally it appears you’ve gone backward, like Dan going bankrupt and getting divorced on the same day, you can turn any experience into a gain. In the gain, rather than being the victim to your experiences and situations, you gratefully learn from every experience and get better. 即使外表看起来你已经倒退了，就像丹破产了，同一天离婚了，你也可以把任何经验转化为收获。在收获中，你不会成为你经历和处境的受害者，而是感激地从每一次经历中学习并变得更好。

Even something truly terrible could happen—you get hit by a car and become paralyzed. You lose a loved one. Or like the Biblical prophet Job, you seemingly lose everything. All of these things can be for your experience, profit, and learning. 即使是真正可怕的事情也可能发生--你被车撞到瘫痪。你失去了心爱的人。或者像圣经中的先知约伯，你似乎失去了一切。所有这些都可以为你的经验，利润和学习。

Turning seeming losses into gains is how you grow and evolve as a person. Once again, humans have an extreme aversion to loss. It’s why we hold on to our 80 percent far longer than we should. Rather than feeling a “loss” whenever you proactively let go of the 80 percent, whatever that may be, now you can better recognize it *as a gain*. 把表面上的损失转化为收获是你成长和进化的方式。再一次，人类对失去有着极端的厌恶。这就是为什么我们坚持 80%的时间远远超过了我们应该坚持的时间。不管你主动放弃这 80%，不管那是什么，都不会感到“损失”，现在你可以更好地认识到这是一种收获。

You’re letting go of something that once brought you value but no longer does so you can now make room for something better. 你放弃了那些曾经给你带来价值但不再有价值的东西，所以你现在可以为更好的东西腾出空间。

Every time you let go of the 80 percent, *you’re gaining massively*. 每次你放弃 80%，你就获得了巨大的收益。

A friend recently told me that he’d let go of alcohol as part of his 80 percent that no longer fit his 10x future self. He didn’t see letting go of alcohol as a loss, but a *huge* gain. 一位朋友最近告诉我，他已经放弃了酒精，因为他 80%的酒精不再适合他未来 10 倍的自我。他不认为戒酒是一种损失，而是一种巨大的收获。

I believe this perspective of “gaining” by letting go is important because I’ve often seen people overly dramatize and ritualize the letting go of their past identity, past successes, certain activities, or even addictions. 我相信这种通过放手来“获得”的观点很重要，因为我经常看到人们过度戏剧化和仪式化地放弃他们过去的身份，过去的成功，某些活动，甚至上瘾。

Instead, just embrace the reality that you’re taking a *major step forward* by letting this thing go—even if it’s something amazing, like a lucrative aspect of your business. It’s literally holding you back at this point! Go forth, my friend, into your 20 percent and let’s see how insane your 10x transformation can be! 相反，接受这样一个现实：你通过放手让这件事向前迈出了重要的一步，即使它是一些令人惊奇的事情，比如你的生意有利可图的方面。它真的在这一点上阻碍了你！去吧，我的朋友，进入你的 20%，让我们看看你的 10 倍转变有多疯狂！

When you’re in the gain, *everything* happens for you. 当你处于有利地位时，一切都为你而发生。

You become antifragile. 你变得反脆弱。

Every experience is valuable. 每一个经验都是宝贵的。

You continually learn from every experience. 你不断地从每一次经历中学习。

You’re always getting better, always learning, always taking nuggets from even the most mundane. 你总是变得更好，总是学习，总是从最平凡的地方得到金块。

## You’ve Gone 10x Before: Review Your 10x Jumps and the “20 Percent” of Those Jumps 你之前已经走了 10 x：回顾你的 10 倍跳跃和这些跳跃的“20%”

*“Time travel backward to the point in your life where you made only one-tenth of what you’re making now. Looking back, could you ever have imagined being where you are right now? Probably not. Just as you probably can’t imagine going 10x in the future. But look at your past, and you can see that you’ve already done it at least once. And you can do it again.” “时光倒流到你生命中的那个点，你只赚了你现在赚的十分之一。回想起来，你能想象到你现在所处的位置吗？可能不会就像你可能无法想象未来会达到 10 倍。但看看你的过去，你会发现你至少已经做过一次了。你可以再做一次。”*

**— DAN SULLIVAN^(16) - DAN SULIVAN ^(16)**

Now that we’ve laid out some of the groundwork of the gain, it’s time to review and reframe your past to better appreciate all the times you’ve gone 10x before. 现在我们已经为你的收获奠定了一些基础，现在是时候回顾和重构你的过去，以更好地欣赏你之前 10 倍的所有时光了。

By seeing 10x more clearly in your own past, you’ll also be able to more clearly see it in your future. 通过更清楚地看到你自己的过去的 10 倍，你也可以更清楚地看到你的未来。

You’ve gone 10x many times. 你已经跑了 10 倍很多次了。

Anytime you’ve committed to something you wanted and transformed through that commitment, *you went 10x*. You made a fundamental and qualitative upgrade that permanently expanded your freedoms and agency. 任何时候，当你致力于你想要的东西，并通过这种承诺转变，你就达到了 10 倍。你们进行了根本性的质的升级，永久地扩大了你们的自由和能动性。

When you went from crawling to walking, *you went 10x*. You committed and transformed yourself. You can look back and see that at one point, you weren’t able to do something and then you made the transformation. 当你从爬行到走路时，你跑了 10 倍。你承诺并改变了自己。你可以回头看看，你曾经做不到什么，然后你做了转变。

When you learned how to speak, *you went 10x*. 当你学会说话的时候，你的速度达到了 10 倍。

When you learned how to read, *you went 10x.* 当你学会阅读的时候，你读了 10 倍。

When you learned how to make friends, *you went 10x.* 当你学会如何交朋友的时候，你的成绩提高了 10 倍。

Anytime you committed to something beyond what you’d done and transformed through that commitment, *you went 10x*. 任何时候，当你致力于超越你所做的事情，并通过这一承诺转变，你就达到了 10 倍。

Learning to drive a car (or fly a plane) is a 10x jump. 学习驾驶汽车（或驾驶飞机）是一个 10 倍的跳跃。

Becoming an entrepreneur is a 10x jump. 成为企业家是一个 10 倍的飞跃。

Anytime you go 10x, you no longer operate as the same person you did prior to the 10x. You’ve altered your identity, mental models, and way of being. You’ve expanded your Unique Ability. 任何时候你去 10 倍，你不再像 10 倍之前的那个人一样操作。你改变了你的身份、思维模式和存在方式。你扩展了你的独特能力。

As a powerful exercise, take some time to reflect back on your previous 10x jumps. Also, reflect on the *core 20 percent* of each of those jumps—the things that remained when you were one-tenth of where you’re at now. Also reflect on the 80 percent you let go of in each jump you made. 作为一个强大的练习，花一些时间来反思你之前的 10 倍跳跃。同时，回想一下每一次跳跃的核心 20%--当你只有现在的十分之一时，你仍然保留下来的东西。也要反思一下你在每次跳跃中放弃的 80%。

By clarifying the 20 percent in each stage, you’ll see how you’ve continually refined your Unique Ability to create 10x freedoms in your life. 通过澄清每个阶段的 20%，你将看到你是如何不断完善你的独特能力，创造 10 倍的自由在你的生活。

I’ll provide a few of my last 10x jumps as an example. 我将提供一些我最近的 10 倍跳跃作为例子。

Committing to serve a two-year church mission was a 10x jump for me. I left on that mission in 2008, and it took almost two years to get myself to a place where I was ready to go. 承诺为一个为期两年的教会使命对我来说是一个 10 倍的飞跃。我在 2008 年离开了那个使命，花了将近两年的时间才让自己到达一个我准备好去的地方。

My 20 percent for this 10x jump of getting on my mission was letting go of the trauma and pain of my past, connecting with my own future, connecting to God, and living my life based on my own standards and decisions rather than succumbing to my current situation or peer group. 我在这 10 倍的跳跃中获得的 20%是放下过去的创伤和痛苦，与我自己的未来联系，与上帝联系，根据我自己的标准和决定来生活，而不是屈服于我目前的处境或同龄人群体。

My 80 percent for this 10x jump was anything and everything that took me away from that 20 percent. Specifically, my 80 percent was holding on to the grudge and anger against my parents for decisions or mistakes they’d made, many of my high school friends, and all other addictions or distractions that were keeping me 2x at that stage in my life, such as video games. 我在 10 倍的跳跃中的 80%是任何东西和一切让我远离那 20%。具体来说，我 80%的人对父母的决定或错误持有怨恨和愤怒，对我的许多高中朋友，以及所有其他让我在那个阶段保持 2 倍的成瘾或分心，比如电子游戏。

After returning from that mission, which transformed my life forever, my next 10x jump was getting into Brigham Young University. Given that I’d barely graduated high school before my mission and had no college credits, this was an unrealistic or “impossible” goal, just as getting on my mission was unrealistic considering what I went through in my childhood. BYU is as competitive as many Ivy League universities. You need straight As and elite test scores. I started at Salt Lake Community College in 2010 with the commitment of attending BYU. 从那个永远改变了我生活的使命回来后，我的下一个 10 倍跳跃是进入杨百翰大学。考虑到我在执行使命之前高中几乎没有毕业，也没有大学学分，这是一个不切实际或“不可能”的目标，就像考虑到我童年经历的事情，完成任务是不切实际的。杨百翰大学和许多常春藤盟校一样具有竞争力。你需要全 A 和精英考试成绩。我开始在盐湖社区学院于 2010 年与承诺参加杨百翰大学。

My 20 percent for getting into BYU was becoming an excellent student, taking full responsibility for my results and grades, learning how to navigate systems and politics, and increasing my commitment to my own goals and standards, rather than getting stuck and content with where I was, which is 2x. 我进入杨百翰大学的 20%是成为一名优秀的学生，对我的成绩和成绩负全部责任，学习如何驾驭系统和政治，并增加我对自己的目标和标准的承诺，而不是陷入困境和满足于我的位置，这是 2 倍。

My 80 percent for this 10x jump was defaulting to old habits, not taking my work and grades seriously, letting my friends dictate my direction, and peer pressure from my employers and others to stay where I was at. 我 80%的 10 倍跳是默认旧习惯，不认真对待我的工作和成绩，让我的朋友决定我的方向，以及来自我的雇主和其他人的同伴压力，让我留在原地。

When I got to BYU in the Fall of 2011, my next 10x was getting married and getting into a PhD program to better my understanding and mastery of psychology—advancing my life and career. 当我在 2011 年秋天来到杨百翰大学时，我的下一个 10 倍是结婚，并进入博士课程，以更好地理解和掌握心理学，推进我的生活和事业。

The 20 percent was becoming the type of person who could identify and attract my 10x life partner, Lauren, as well as learning psychology and philosophy at an extremely high level. It also became important to learn how to write and research at a PhD level. 这 20%的人正在成为那种能够识别和吸引我 10 倍生活伴侣劳伦的人，以及在极高水平上学习心理学和哲学的人。学习如何在博士水平上写作和研究也变得很重要。

The first time I applied to graduate school, I got rejected by 15 different programs. I turned this into a major gain by looking in the mirror and committing to get better, rather than being bitter as a victim. 我第一次申请研究生院时，被 15 个不同的项目拒绝了。我通过照照镜子，承诺要变得更好，而不是像受害者一样痛苦，把这变成了一个重大的收获。

My commitment to learning and getting better enabled me to find a young professor who became one of my greatest friends and mentors, Dr. Nate Lambert. Nate taught me how to research and write with confidence—skills I’m still using to write this book. Together, Nate and I submitted over 15 academic papers for publication, which easily enabled me to get into the best PhD program for me—organizational psychology at Clemson University. 我对学习和进步的承诺使我找到了一位年轻的教授，他成为了我最好的朋友和导师之一。内特·兰伯特。内特教会了我如何自信地进行研究和写作--我至今仍在用这种技巧来写这本书。内特和我一起提交了超过 15 篇学术论文供发表，这使我很容易地进入了克莱姆森大学最适合我的博士课程-组织心理学。

Once at Clemson in the Fall of 2014, my next 10x was growing our family, completing my PhD, and becoming a professional author. Specifically, I committed to getting a six-figure book contract from a major publisher. This was my *keystone goal*—the one outcome I believed would create much of the freedom and opportunity I wanted. Achieving this one goal would enable me to provide for my family doing what I loved. 有一次在克莱姆森在 2014 年秋天，我的下一个 10 倍是扩大我们的家庭，完成我的博士学位，并成为一名专业作家。具体来说，我承诺从一家主要出版商那里得到一份六位数的图书合同。这是我的基本目标--我相信这一结果会创造我想要的自由和机会。实现这一目标将使我能够为我的家人提供我喜欢的事情。

The 20 percent of this 10x was overcoming my fears and anxieties of sharing my ideas and writing publicly, learning to write effectively, learning to write virally, and learning how to build a massive audience and email list of people who wanted more of my writing. 这 10 倍中的 20%是克服了我的恐惧和焦虑，我分享我的想法和公开写作，学习有效地写作，学习病毒式写作，学习如何建立一个庞大的读者群和电子邮件名单，这些人希望我的写作更多。

I started blogging online in Spring of 2015 and wrote hundreds of blog posts. Over the next 18 months, my blogs were read by tens of millions of people and I grew my email list to over 100,000 people. In February of 2017, I got a $220,000 book deal from Hachette, one of the Big-5 New York publishers. *Willpower Doesn’t Work,* my first major book, was published in March of 2018\. One month earlier, in February of 2018, Lauren and I were granted adoption of the three children we’d been fostering the previous three years. Lauren also gave birth to twin girls in December of 2018\. In April of 2019, I completed my PhD. 我在 2015 年春天开始在网上写博客，写了数百篇博文。在接下来的 18 个月里，我的博客被数千万人阅读，我的电子邮件列表增加到了 10 万人。2017 年 2 月，我从纽约五大出版商之一 Hachette 那里获得了 22 万美元的图书合同。《意志力不起作用》是我的第一本重要著作，于 2018 年 3 月出版。一个月前，也就是 2018 年 2 月，劳伦和我被批准收养我们过去三年一直在抚养的三个孩子。劳伦也在 2018 年 12 月生下了一对双胞胎女儿。2019 年 4 月，我完成了博士学位。

I’m writing these words near the end of 2022 and have gone 10x again since completing my PhD three and a half years ago. Since completing my PhD, I’ve published five bestselling books, including three with Dan Sullivan. I’ve 10xed the amount of money I invest toward retirement. Lauren and I have 10xed our emotional development and maturity toward our children. 我在 2022 年底写这些话，自从三年半前完成博士学位以来，我又翻了 10 倍。自从完成博士学位以来，我出版了五本畅销书，其中三本是丹·沙利文合著的。我已经把我为退休投资的钱打了十倍。劳伦和我已经对孩子们的情感发展和成熟度进行了 10 次调整。

My 80 percent of the past three and a half years has been letting go of people-pleasing, saying “Yes” to opportunities or situations I already know aren’t interesting to me, and needing to be right. I’ve also let go of needing to always be productive. I’ve embraced recovery and relaxing, and slowing time down. 在过去的三年半里，我 80%的时间都在放弃取悦他人，对那些我已经知道对我来说并不感兴趣的机会或情况说“是”，并且需要正确。我也放弃了总是有效率的需求。我接受了恢复和放松，并放慢时间。

That brings me to the *current 10x jump I’m still in the middle of*, which I’ve been in the past year or so. My 10x process right now is focused on becoming an amazing and loving husband and father to my six children, writing 10x better and more impactful books that sell millions of copies, and 10xing my financial freedom. 这让我想到了目前的 10 倍跳跃，我仍然处于中间，我已经在过去一年左右。我现在的 10 倍过程专注于成为一个了不起的，爱我的六个孩子的丈夫和父亲，写 10 倍更好，更有影响力的书，销售数百万册，和 10 倍我的财务自由。

This is what I personally want. 这是我个人想要的。

Other people’s opinions of my 10x goals don’t really matter. 别人对我 10 倍目标的看法并不重要。

This doesn’t mean I don’t listen. It doesn’t mean I’m locked-in and inflexible, or unchangeable. It simply means that I want what I want. 这不代表我不听。这并不意味着我是封闭的，僵化的，或者一成不变的。它只是意味着我想要我想要的。

The same is true for you. 你也是如此。

You get to choose the 10x process and focus you most want in your life, based on the standards and freedoms you want to experience for yourself. 你可以根据你想要亲身体验的标准和自由，选择你生活中最想要的 10 倍过程和专注。

You don’t have to justify your 10x dreams. 你不必为你的 10 倍梦想辩护。

At every 10x stage, there is a 20 percent you’re to focus on and master and an 80 percent that will stop at nothing to keep you where you’re at. 在每一个 10 倍的阶段，有 20%的你需要专注和掌握，而 80%的你将不惜一切代价来保持你的位置。

At each 10x stage, the 20 percent will stack and build upon each 20 percent of your previous 10x stages. Your Unique Ability will continue to develop, often in non-linear and surprising ways. 在每个 10x 阶段，20%将叠加并构建在之前 10x 阶段的每 20%之上。你的独特能力将继续发展，通常以非线性和令人惊讶的方式发展。

At each 10x level, your life will get better and freer, yet the 80 percent will not go away, it will only be different. You’ll be tempted and even pressured to shift from 10x to 2x, wherein you allow the continually spawning 80 percent to distract you from going all-in on the next 20 percent. 每过 10 倍，你的生活会变得更好更自由，但 80%不会消失，只会有所不同。你会受到诱惑，甚至是压力，从 10 倍转换到 2 倍，在这个过程中，你允许不断产生的 80%来分散你的注意力，而不是全力以赴地投入下一个 20%。

**Now it’s your turn: 现在轮到你了：**

*   Identify five of your past 10x jumps. 找出你过去 10 倍跳跃中的 5 次。
*   Give each of your previous 10x jumps a name and a timeline. For example, mine could be named: Getting on the mission (2006-2008), getting into BYU (2010-2011), getting married and into a PhD program (2011-2014), growing my family and becoming a well-paid professional author (2014-2019), 10xing as an author and evolving emotionally as a person (2019-present). 给予你之前的每一次 10 次跳跃一个名字和时间轴。例如，mine 可以命名为：接受使命（2006-2008），进入杨百翰大学（2010-2011），结婚并进入博士课程（2011-2014），成长我的家庭，成为一个高薪的专业作家（2014-2019），10 星作为一个作家和发展情感作为一个人（2019 年至今）。
*   Clarify the 20 percent of each of your 10x jumps, as well as the 80 percent that you let go of at each level. 澄清你每一次 10 倍跳跃的 20%，以及你在每个关卡中放弃的 80%。
*   As you reflect on the 20 percent of each 10x jump you’ve made, reflect on how that 20 percent helped you further develop your Unique Ability. 当你反思每 10 倍跳跃的 20%时，想想这 20%是如何帮助你进一步发展你的独特能力的。

Make mapping your previous 10x jumps a habit. Review and further contextualize them regularly. As you study and expand your past, you’ll learn more and more from it, which will better enable you to clarify your 10x future. 把你以前的 10 倍跳跃映射成一种习惯。定期审查并进一步了解这些内容。当你研究和扩展你的过去时，你会从中学到越来越多的东西，这将更好地让你澄清你的 10 倍未来。

Staying in the gain is essential fuel, perspective, and happiness that will not only carry you forward on your 10x quests, but it will also ensure you’re making the *right* 10x jumps moving forward. By “right” 10x jumps, I mean the 10x jumps that you *most want*, rather than seeking what society, culture, social media, or anyone else has trained you to think you want or need. 保持在收获中是必不可少的燃料，视角和快乐，不仅会让你在 10 倍任务中前进，而且也会确保你做出正确的 10 倍跳跃前进。所谓“正确”的 10 倍跳跃，我的意思是你最想要的 10 倍跳跃，而不是寻找社会，文化，社交媒体，或其他任何人训练你认为你想要或需要的东西。

Being in the gain supports living the life you want, and it helps you appreciate where you are now. You can continue advancing 10x as you want, but you don’t need 10x to be happy or worthy. 在收获中支持过你想要的生活，它帮助你欣赏你现在所处的位置。你可以继续按照自己的意愿前进 10 倍，但你不需要 10 倍才能快乐或有价值。

You’re in the gain. You’re already happy and worthy. 你赢了。你已经很幸福很有价值了。

Continuing to go 10x and transform your Unique Ability will simply enrich the happiness you already have. 继续 10 倍，转变你的独特能力，只会丰富你已经拥有的快乐。

As Thich Nhat Hahn said, *“There is no way to happiness—happiness is the way.”* 正如 Thich Nhat Hahn 所说，“没有通往幸福的道路--幸福就是道路。”

Take a deep breath. 深呼吸

Exhale. 呼气

You’re in the gain. 你赢了。

You’re making amazing progress. 你的进步很惊人。

You’re exactly where you should be. 你就在你该在的地方。

Measuring your gains enables you to frame your past effectively. It also enables you to make your past more concrete and measurable—where you can actually see and appreciate all the progress and growth you’ve made. You’re not the same person you were even last week. 衡量你的收获使你能够有效地构建你的过去。它还能让你把你的过去变得更具体和更可衡量你能真正看到和欣赏你所取得的进步和成长。你已经不是上周的你了。

By reflecting on your gains and valuing your progress, you’re now in a better place to *think forward* about the next 10x jumps you want to make. For the remainder of this chapter, we will dive into two specific ways you can begin conceptualizing your next 10x jump. 通过反思你的收获和评估你的进步，你现在处于一个更好的位置来思考你想要做出的下一个 10 倍跳跃。在本章剩下的部分，我们将深入探讨两种具体的方法，你可以开始概念化你的下一个 10 倍跳跃。

The first is a concept known as “fitness function”—which helps you get hyper-clear and specific about who you want to become. 第一个是一个被称为“健身函数”的概念，它可以帮助你对自己想成为什么样的人非常清楚和具体。

The second concept is a classic tool Dan Sullivan uses to help his entrepreneurs envision 10x, which is imagining your “Dream Check.” Both of these applications—fitness function and Dream Check—will help you better clarify your next 20 percent focus, and where you will use your Unique Ability. 第二个概念是 Dan Sullivan 用来帮助他的企业家设想 10 倍的经典工具，也就是想象你的“梦想检查”。这两个应用程序-健身功能和梦想检查-将帮助你更好地明确你的下一个 20%的重点，以及你将在哪里使用你的独特能力。

## Define Your “Fitness Function”—You Become What You Focus On 定义你的“健身功能”-你成为你关注的对象

*“The biggest understanding and capability you gain from transforming your past experiences into lessons is being able to define your standards. You know what’s acceptable and what’s unacceptable, and this knowledge is what matters most. You create powerful filters of high personal standards by which you determine which ongoing experiences are best for growth.” “你从将过去的经验转化为教训中获得的最大理解和能力是能够定义你的标准。你知道什么是可接受的，什么是不可接受的，而这一点才是最重要的。你创建了高个人标准的强大过滤器，通过这些过滤器，你可以确定哪些持续经历最有利于成长。*

**— DAN SULLIVAN - 丹·苏利文**

In computer and evolutionary sciences, *fitness function* means clarifying the qualities and measurement of a specific objective. Put simply, fitness function clarifies *what you’re optimizing for*—your chosen standards—and the “fitness” or developmental path required to live those standards. 在计算机和进化科学中，适应度函数意味着澄清特定目标的性质和度量。简而言之，健身功能阐明了你正在优化的目标--你选择的标准--以及满足这些标准所需的“健身”或发展路径。

This is vitally important, and understanding fitness function will enable you to better clarify your 20 percent and next-level Unique Ability. It helps you get highly specific about *what you want*, as well as the specific growth and value you’ll experience. 这是至关重要的，了解健身功能将使你更好地阐明你的 20%和下一级独特能力。它可以帮助你高度明确你想要什么，以及你将体验到的具体增长和价值。

Fitness function is similar to looking at the direction and destination of an airplane. A slight tweak in direction—even a few degrees different—over a long enough period of time leads to massive differences. Even being *one degree off* for a long enough period of time will lead you hundreds or thousands of miles away from your desired destination. 健身功能类似于查看飞机的方向和目的地。在足够长的时间内，方向上的一个微小的调整，即使是几度的差异，也会导致巨大的差异。即使在足够长的时间内偏离一度，也会让你远离你想要的目的地数百或数千英里。

The famed German pilot Dieter Utchdorf has explained this principle with the tragic 1979 plane crash in Antarctica. It was a large passenger jet with 257 people on board that left New Zealand for a sightseeing flight to Antarctica and back. 著名的德国飞行员迪特尔·乌奇多夫（Dieter Uchdorf）用 1979 年在南极洲的悲惨飞机失事解释了这一原则。这是一架载有 257 人的大型客机，从新西兰出发前往南极洲并返回。

As Utchdorf explains: 正如 Uchdorf 所解释的：

“Unknown to the pilots, however, someone had modified the flight coordinates by a mere two degrees. This error placed the aircraft 28 miles (45 km) to the east of where the pilots assumed they were. As they approached Antarctica, the pilots descended to a lower altitude to give the passengers a better look at the landscape. Although both were experienced pilots, neither had made this particular flight before, and they had no way of knowing that the incorrect coordinates had placed them directly in the path of Mount Erebus, an active volcano that rises from the frozen landscape to a height of more than 12,000 feet (3,700 m). As the pilots flew onward, the white of the snow and ice covering the volcano blended with the white of the clouds above, making it appear as though they were flying over flat ground. By the time the instruments sounded the warning that the ground was rising fast toward them, it was too late. The airplane crashed into the side of the volcano, killing everyone on board. It was a terrible tragedy brought on by a minor error—a matter of only a few degrees.”^(17) “然而，飞行员不知道的是，有人将飞行坐标仅修改了两度。这一错误使飞机在飞行员假设的地方以东 28 英里（45 公里）。当他们接近南极洲时，飞行员下降到较低的高度，以便给予乘客更好地看到风景。虽然两人都是经验丰富的飞行员，但他们之前都没有进行过这种飞行，他们不知道错误的坐标将他们直接置于埃里伯斯火山的路径上，埃里伯斯火山是一座从冰冻地形上升到超过 12，000 英尺（3，700 米）高度的活火山。飞行员们一路前行，覆盖着火山的白色冰雪和天空的白色云层融合在一起，就像是在平地上飞行。当仪器发出警告时，地面正在迅速上升，向他们走来，已经太晚了。 飞机撞向火山的侧面，机上所有的人都遇难了。这是一场可怕的悲剧，是由一个小错误--只是几度的问题。“第 0#个

Similar to airplanes, but with even greater implications, your fitness function points in the direction you’re ultimately going and simultaneously who you’re ultimately *becoming.* Even a slight tweak in direction and destination will lead you to become a radically different person than you would have been. 与飞机类似，但更有意义的是，你的健身功能指向你最终要去的方向，同时也指向你最终要成为的人。即使在方向和目的地上有一点小小的改变，也会让你变成一个完全不同的人。

The details matter here. 这里的细节很重要。

Your own fitness function will be unique to you, because what you most want and the specific standards by which you define success are also unique to you. 你自己的健身功能对你来说是独一无二的，因为你最想要的东西和你定义成功的具体标准也是独一无二的。

By defining your fitness function, you’ll know where to focus your energy. You’ll know the 20 percent to go all-in on. And you’ll know when you’re being successful. 通过定义你的健身功能，你将知道在哪里集中你的能量。你会知道 20%的钱全押。当你成功的时候你就会知道。

No one else has the exact same goals or standards you do. Therefore, measuring yourself against someone else’s results or standards is a losing game because you’re not ultimately optimizing for the same thing. You’re not playing the same game . . . 没有其他人有和你完全相同的目标或标准。因此，用别人的结果或标准来衡量自己是一场失败的游戏，因为你最终没有为同一件事情进行优化。你不是在玩同一个游戏。. .

Your standards aren’t the same as anyone else’s. 你的标准和别人不一样。

Your objective isn’t the same. 你的目标不一样。

Your Unique Ability and calling aren’t the same. 你的独特能力和召唤是不一样的。

There is no external competition. 没有外部竞争。

Therefore, measuring yourself against someone else’s results and standards is a sure path to becoming average or good, but never uniquely great, one-of-a-kind, and world-class. You can’t beat someone else at being them, just like someone else cannot beat you at being you. 因此，用别人的成绩和标准来衡量自己是一条通往平均或优秀的道路，但永远不会成为独一无二的伟大、独一无二的世界级。你不能在成为他们时打败别人，就像别人不能在成为你一样。

*The scariest and most courageous thing you’ll ever do is to be yourself. 你所做的最可怕、最勇敢的事就是做你自己。*

I’m still learning this lesson, as I often find myself measuring and comparing myself with other authors. Yet, in a recent conversation with my friend and artificial intelligence expert and entrepreneur Howard Getson, I was reminded that *my* fitness function (what I’m optimizing for—my Unique Ability and calling) is radically different than those other authors’. What they’re going for and what I’m going for are totally different, especially in terms of who we’re becoming. 我仍然在学习这一课，因为我经常发现自己在衡量和比较自己与其他作者。然而，在最近与我的朋友、人工智能专家和企业家霍华德 Getson 的一次谈话中，我被提醒说，我的适应度函数（我正在优化的是我的独特能力和调用）与其他作者的完全不同。他们的追求和我的追求是完全不同的，特别是在我们成为什么样的人方面。

Sure, we may use similar metrics like book sales to measure our progress. But if “book sales” was purely the fitness function of what I was going for, I’d most certainly be writing different books. So, number of books sold *isn’t* my primary fitness function, though it’s certainly part of what I’m optimizing for. 当然，我们可以使用类似的指标，比如图书销售额来衡量我们的进步。但如果“图书销售”纯粹是我追求的健身功能，我肯定会写不同的书。所以，图书销量并不是我的主要适应度函数，尽管它肯定是我正在优化的一部分。

My fitness function is different from anyone else’s and highly specific. 我的健身功能与其他人不同，而且非常具体。

So is yours. 你的也是

What are you ultimately going for? 你最终的目标是什么？

What are you “optimizing” for? 你在“优化”什么？

What level of capability and results do you want to develop and master? 你想培养和掌握什么水平的能力和成果？

What are the standards you want to refine and actualize? 您想要完善和实现的标准是什么？

Defining your fitness function is as simple as defining the specific standards or criteria you want to grow into. The criteria you feel called to and want to create. 定义你的适应度函数就像定义你想要成长的特定标准或准则一样简单。你觉得被召唤并想要创造的标准。

The more specific your fitness function, the more specialized, nuanced, and valuable you will become. 你的健身功能越具体，你就会变得越专业，越细致，越有价值。

Your agency as a person is based on what you choose to develop yourself into. 你作为一个人的代理是基于你选择发展自己的。

We all will become someone. 我们都会成为某个人。

It’s your responsibility to define what you want and to direct your focus and attention toward that. 你的责任是定义你想要什么，并将你的注意力和注意力引向它。

*Your fitness function is your filter.* It filters not only what’s important and what’s not important. It also filters *what you see* and what you don’t see—your *selective attention*.^(18,19) 你的健身功能就是你的过滤器。它不仅过滤了重要的和不重要的东西。它还过滤了你看到的和你看不到的--你的选择性注意力。 ^(18,19)

As you clarify the specific 10x transformation you want, that 10x becomes your filter of the world. Over time as you get more committed to it, you not only become more optimized and specialized for that particular thing, *but you also begin filtering everything else out.* 当你明确了你想要的特定 10 倍转换时，这个 10 倍就成为了你对世界的过滤器。随着时间的推移，随着你越来越投入，你不仅变得更加优化和专业化，而且你也开始过滤其他所有东西。

The economic term for this is *opportunity cost.* 经济学术语是机会成本。

The evolutionary or biological term for this is *atrophy*. 进化或生物学术语称之为萎缩。

You *will* atrophy and become increasingly unaware in the areas outside your filter. 你会萎缩，在过滤器之外的区域变得越来越不知觉。

By getting committed to something specific—a chosen fitness function—you become an increasingly specific and unique type of person. You stop seeing, noticing, and paying attention to anything that isn’t relevant to your perceptual filter. 通过致力于某些特定的事情--一个选定的健身功能--你会成为一个越来越特定和独特的人。你不再去看、注意和关注任何与你的感知过滤器无关的东西。

Whatever you focus on *expands*. 无论你专注于什么，都会扩展。

Whatever you focus on, *you create more of*. 无论你专注于什么，你都会创造更多。

Whatever you focus on, *you become*. 无论你专注于什么，你就会成为什么。

Whatever you focus on, you develop a finer, more nuanced, and more specific understanding of. As author Robert Kiyosaki stated, “Intelligence is the ability to make finer distinctions.”^(20) 无论你专注于什么，你都会发展出更精细、更细致、更具体的理解。正如作家罗伯特·清崎所言：“智力是做出更精细区分的能力。” ^(20)

“Finer distinctions” describes a finer and more nuanced understanding of a particular thing. The more you pay attention to and focus on something, the finer the distinctions you develop for that particular thing. Take football, for example. Someone who is merely a casual fan watching a game isn’t watching the same game as someone who really understands the game. “更精细的区别”描述了对特定事物的更精细、更细致的理解。你越是关注和专注于某件事，你对某件事的区别就越明显。比如足球。一个仅仅是一个看比赛的普通球迷的人并不像真正了解比赛的人在看同一场比赛。

The person who understands the game will see far more nuance and meaning—*finer distinctions*—within every facet of the game than the casual watcher. They’ll recognize important subtleties that the casual observer won’t notice, such as whether or not the left tackle on one team is the starter or the backup. The implications of even the seemingly smallest details will be gargantuan to the person making finer distinctions. The person with greater understanding sees and understands the situation more systemically, recognizing that even small tweaks to even small individual parts can create massive and non-linear changes to the overall whole. 了解游戏的人会比普通的旁观者看到更多的细微差别和意义更细微的区别在游戏的各个方面。他们会认识到一些不经意的观察者不会注意到的细微之处，比如一个球队的左路铲球是首发还是替补。即使是表面上最小的细节，对做出更精细区分的人来说也是巨大的。理解力更强的人会更系统地看待和理解情况，认识到即使是对微小的个别部分进行微小的调整也会对整体造成巨大的非线性变化。

The scientific term for this level of systemic thinking is the *Butterfly Effect*, a concept initially developed by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz, who used the analogy of the exact time and path of a tornado being influenced by minor vibrations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier.^(21,22,23,24) 这种系统性思维水平的科学术语是蝴蝶效应，这个概念最初由数学家和气象学家爱德华·诺顿·洛伦茨提出，他使用龙卷风的确切时间和路径受到微小振动的影响，例如几周前远处的蝴蝶拍打翅膀。 ^(21,22,23,24)

Seeing finer distinctions is the difference between high definition and low definition—the difference between mastery and excellence, or less. One has far more detail and precision. But also, one has unique angles and connections made through study and commitment, whereas the other person only has a surface-level perspective. 看到更细微的区别就是高清晰度和低清晰度之间的区别--精通和卓越之间的区别，或者更少。一个有更多的细节和精确。但是，一个人通过学习和承诺有独特的角度和联系，而另一个人只有表面层次的视角。

Consider driving: When you first learn, your conscious mind is required to pay extreme attention to each little aspect, such as signaling when changing lanes. But as you drive more and more, you group multiple aspects of driving together in your memory such that you can unconsciously perform literally hundreds of individual tasks at the same time. The parts have integrated into a new whole. 考虑开车：当你第一次学习的时候，你的意识需要对每个小方面给予极度的关注，比如在变道时发出信号。但随着你开车的次数越来越多，你会把驾驶的多个方面组合在一起，这样你就可以在无意识的同时完成数百项单独的任务。这些部分已融为一个新的整体。

When viewing a particular situation—such as a car accident—the experienced driver has a better understanding of what may have occurred than a newbie driver who will have a surface-level and likely inaccurate understanding of the what and why of a particular situation. 当看到一个特定的情况时，例如车祸，经验丰富的司机对可能发生的事情有更好的理解，而新手司机对特定情况的事情和原因有一个表面水平的理解，可能不准确。

The author and learning expert Josh Waitzkin describes this idea of finer distinctions and developing a more granular and systemic level of mastery in his book *The Art of Learning*.^(25) 作者和学习专家乔希·韦茨金（Josh Waitzkin）在他的著作《学习的艺术》（The Art of Learning）中描述了这种更精细的区分和发展更精细、更系统的掌握水平的想法。 ^(25)

Josh grew up a chess prodigy and went on to become a chess champion. He then shifted his interests to various forms of martial arts, wherein he also went on to become world champion. 乔希成长为国际象棋天才，后来成为国际象棋冠军。然后，他将兴趣转向各种形式的武术，其中他也继续成为世界冠军。

“Making Smaller Circles” is how Josh describes cultivating finer distinctions—which is a process of zooming further and further into something. The better you understand and experience something, the more your brain chunks your understanding together with other things. The psychological term for this is *automaticity* and it’s how you go from consciously doing something to mastering it on the unconscious level.^(26,27) “使小圈子”是乔希描述培养更精细的区别--这是一个越来越远的过程。你对某件事的理解和体验越深，你的大脑就越多地将你的理解与其他事物结合在一起。心理学术语是自动性，它是你如何从有意识地做某事到在无意识水平上掌握它。 ^(26,27)

As Josh describes: 正如 Josh 描述的：

“Most people would be surprised to discover that if you compare the thought process of a Grandmaster to that of an expert (a much weaker, but quite competent chess player), you will often find that the Grandmaster consciously looks at less, not more. That said, the chunks of information that have been put together in his mind allow him to see much more with much less conscious thought. So he is looking at very little and seeing quite a lot. . . Now think of me, Josh, competing against a less refined martial artist. Let’s say I am in the process of instigating a throw that involves six technical steps. My opponent will experience an indecipherable flurry of action, while for me the six external steps of the throw are just the outer rim of a huge network of chunks. Our realities are very different. I am ‘seeing’ much more than he is seeing. . . Experientially, because I am looking at less, there are, within the same unit of time, hundreds of frames in my mind, and maybe only a few for my opponent (whose conscious mind is bogged down with much more data that has not yet been internalized as unconsciously accessible). I can now operate in all those frames that he doesn’t even see.” “大多数人会惊讶地发现，如果你将大师的思维过程与高手（一个弱得多，但相当能干的棋手）进行比较，你往往会发现大师有意识地看得更少，而不是更多。也就是说，在他的脑海中拼凑起来的大量信息让他用更少的意识思考看到更多。所以他看的很少，看的却很多。. .现在想想我，乔什，和一个不那么精致的武术家竞争。假设我正在发起一个涉及六个技术步骤的投掷。我的对手将经历一场难以辨认的动作，而对我来说，投掷的六个外部步骤只是一个巨大的块网络的外缘。我们的现实情况大不相同。我看到的比他看到的更多。. . 从经验上看，因为我看到的东西越来越少，所以在同一个时间单位内，我的脑海里有数百个帧，而我的对手可能只有几个帧（他的意识思维被更多的数据所困，而这些数据还没有被内化为无意识可达）。我现在可以在所有他看不见的画面中操作了。“

What does all of this have to do with 10x and clarifying your 20 percent? 这一切与 10 倍和澄清你的 20%有什么关系？

Put bluntly, as a person, *you are now in the process of becoming someone specific.* You are optimizing for *something*—whatever your standards are—even if that something isn’t well defined or intentioned. You’re making finer distinctions and developing expertise in whatever you’re focusing on. In our world of distraction, many people are developing finer distinctions and expertise in random things like celebrities’ lives, video games, etc. 坦率地说，作为一个人，你现在正在成为一个特定的人。无论你的标准是什么，你都在优化某些东西，即使那些东西没有很好的定义或意图。无论你专注于什么，你都在做出更好的区分和发展专业知识。在我们这个分心的世界里，许多人正在发展更精细的区别和专业知识，如名人的生活，电子游戏等随机的事情。

Whatever you focus on expands. 无论你专注于什么，都会扩展。

Whatever you focus on, you develop finer distinctions in. 无论你专注于什么，你都会在其中发展出更好的区别。

Whatever you focus on, you create more of. 无论你专注于什么，你都会创造更多。

Whatever you focus on, you become in an increasingly specific way to the exclusion of all else. 无论你专注于什么，你都会以一种越来越具体的方式将其他一切排除在外。

The number one goal of life is developing mastery in your Unique Ability and thus living out your unique calling and purpose at the highest possible level. There is no end or ultimate “arrival” to this process. It’s a continuing process of developing higher value and quality of freedom in all key areas, and doing so in your own unique way. 人生的首要目标是掌握你独特的能力，从而在最高水平上活出你独特的使命和使命。这个过程没有结束或最终的“到达”。这是一个在所有关键领域发展更高价值和自由质量的持续过程，并以自己独特的方式这样做。

The more specific you get in what you want, the clearer will be the 20 percent rabbit hole you go down. 你在你想要的东西中得到的越具体，你就越清楚 20%的兔子洞。

Whatever you pay most attention to becomes your filter to the world. Your attention filters what you see and what you don’t see. It also reflects who you will *eventually become*. 你最关注的东西，都成为你对世界的过滤器。你的注意力过滤了你看到的和你看不到的。这也反映了你最终会成为什么样的人。

Your continued focus develops extremely fine distinctions and expertise in whatever you commit yourself to. Thus, in defining your 10x, you want to be as specific as possible about how you define and measure success (i.e., your “standards”). 你持续的专注会在你所承诺的任何事情上发展出极其精细的区别和专业知识。因此，在定义你的 10x 时，你要尽可能具体地定义和衡量成功（即，你的“标准”）。

Your standards will be your own. 你的标准将是你自己的。

Your 10x transformation will also be your own. 你的 10 倍转变也将是你自己的。

Who you become will be incomparable and unique to anyone else. 你成为谁将是其他人无法比拟的和独一无二的。

Your 10x transformation will become highly specific. It will also make you into someone more specific—and more valuable and unique. 您的 10 倍转换将变得非常具体。它也会让你成为一个更特殊的人，更有价值和独特的人。

**What about you? 那你呢？**

*   What are you optimizing for? 你在优化什么？
*   What do you ultimately want to be and do? 你最终想成为什么，做什么？
*   What standards do you want to create and realize? 你想创建和实现什么样的标准？
*   What *minimum standards*—such as the level of client you work with or time it takes to run a marathon—will help you adapt and evolve to where you want to be? 什么样的最低标准--比如你的客户级别或跑马拉松所需的时间--将帮助你适应和发展到你想要的地方？
*   What is your fitness function—the capabilities and results you want to be able to produce and master? 什么是你的健身功能-你希望能够产生和掌握的能力和结果？

## Define Your “Dream Check” 定义你的“梦想检查”

*“To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect . . . I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they’re out. If you’re in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.” “要想致富，你需要让自己处于一个有两样东西的境地，衡量和杠杆。你需要处于一个可以衡量你的表现的位置，否则没有办法通过做更多的事情来获得更多的报酬。你必须有杠杆作用，因为你所做的决定会产生很大的影响。. .我想每一个靠自己努力致富的人，都会被发现处于一个有衡量和杠杆的境地。我能想到的每个人都这样做：首席执行官电影明星对冲基金经理职业运动员。杠杆存在的一个很好的暗示是失败的可能性。上行必须与下行平衡，因此，如果有巨大的收益潜力，也必然有可怕的损失可能性。CEO、明星、基金经理、运动员，都是顶着利剑生活;一旦开始吸，他们就出局了如果你从事一份感觉安全的工作，你就不会致富，因为如果没有危险，几乎可以肯定没有杠杆作用。*

**— PAUL GRAHAM^(28) - 保罗·格雷厄姆 ^(28)**

Despite growing up so poor that for a time his family lived in their Volkswagen van on a relative’s lawn, Jim Carrey believed in his future. Every night in the late 1980s, Carrey would drive way up into the Hollywood Hills that looked down over Los Angeles. He would park his car, look down over the city, and visualize directors valuing his work. At the time, he was a broke and struggling young comic. 尽管金·凯瑞从小家境贫寒，有一段时间他的家人住在亲戚家的草坪上的大众货车里，但他对自己的未来充满信心。在 20 世纪 80 年代末的每个晚上，凯瑞都会开车进入俯瞰洛杉矶的好莱坞山。他会停好车，俯瞰整个城市，想象导演们对他的作品的评价。当时，他是一个破产和挣扎的年轻喜剧演员。

One night in 1990, while looking down on Los Angeles and dreaming of his future, Carrey wrote himself a check for $10 million and put in the notation line “for acting services rendered.” He dated the check for Thanksgiving 1995 and stuck it in his wallet. 1990 年的一个晚上，在俯瞰洛杉矶，梦想着自己的未来时，凯瑞给自己写了一张 1000 万美元的支票，并在符号行上写了“为表演服务提供”。他在 1995 年感恩节的支票上注明了日期，然后把它塞进了钱包里。

He gave himself five years *to become the type of person* whose Unique Ability was valued at that price. 他给了自己五年的时间，让自己成为那种特殊能力被看重的人。

Just before Thanksgiving of 1995, he got paid $10 million for *Dumb and Dumber*. 就在 1995 年感恩节前，他获得了 1000 万美元的《Dumb and Dumber》。

Jim Carrey was highly specific in the standards he set for himself. His wasn’t a random evolution but a highly conscious and specific one, based on the fitness function he chose for himself. 金·凯瑞对自己设定的标准非常具体。他的进化不是随机进化，而是一种高度自觉和特定的进化，基于他为自己选择的适应度函数。

As a person and actor, he went 10x many times. 作为一个人和演员，他走了 10 倍很多次。

He transformed himself and his Unique Ability over and over through full commitment to his dream and calling. 他一遍又一遍地改变了自己和他的独特能力，通过对他的梦想和召唤的完全承诺。

He became a true master of his craft. No one else could do what he did. 他成了他这门手艺的真正大师。没有人能做到他所做的。

One way Dan Sullivan helps entrepreneurs clarify their next 10x, and thus illuminates where to develop their Unique Ability further, is what he calls the “Dream Check.” Jim Carrey applied this principle—writing a Dream Check of $10 million to do a single movie—to become one of the most unique and successful comedian actors of his time. 丹·沙利文帮助创业者明确他们的下一个 10 倍，从而阐明在哪里进一步发展他们的独特能力，这是他所谓的“梦想检查”。金·凯瑞运用了这个原则--写了一张 1000 万美元的梦想支票来拍一部电影--成为他那个时代最独特、最成功的喜剧演员之一。

There is good money and bad money. 有好钱和坏钱。

*Freedom of Money* is about *quality money*, wherein you’re making money in the most exciting, energizing, and transformational way possible—by utilizing and further mastering your Unique Ability. 金钱的自由是关于质量的金钱，在其中你赚钱的最令人兴奋，最有活力，和转型可能的方式-通过利用和进一步掌握你的独特能力。

Think about the largest check you were ever paid to do something that you felt was exciting, and ultimately *play.* 想想你曾经得到的最大的支票，让你做一些你觉得令人兴奋的事情，并最终玩。

You got paid to do something you would have done for free. 你得到报酬是为了做一些你可以免费做的事。

Being paid for your Unique Ability *is* living your dream. It’s also increasingly important if you want to make bigger 10x leaps, individually and as a business. If an entrepreneur doesn’t 10x the value and impact of their Unique Ability, the whole business will falter and struggle. Moreover, the whole team will follow the entrepreneur’s lead and be caught-up in the busy 80 percent that isn’t energizing and isn’t where they can be their best. 为你的独特能力付出代价就是实现你的梦想。如果你想实现更大的 10 倍飞跃，无论是个人还是企业，这一点也越来越重要。如果一个企业家不能将其独特能力的价值和影响力提高 10 倍，整个企业将步履蹒跚和挣扎。此外，整个团队将跟随企业家的领导，并被困在忙碌的 80%，没有活力，不是他们可以发挥最好的地方。

The more you develop your Unique Ability, the higher the value the right people will place on it. 你越是发展你的独特能力，合适的人就会给予你更高的价值。

The more you invest in your Unique Ability, the more 10x transformations you will make. Your Unique Ability is how you transform yourself again and again into the most unique, valuable, and true form of yourself. Unique Ability is how you create *unique wealth and value*, which others will happily pay increasing amounts of finite money for. 你在你的独特能力上投入的越多，你将做出的 10 倍的转变就越多。你的独特能力是你如何一次又一次地将自己转变成最独特、最有价值和最真实的自己。独特的能力是你如何创造独特的财富和价值，其他人会乐意为之付出越来越多的有限的金钱。

Your Dream Check can point the way to what you focus on and optimize yourself for. It clarifies your 20 percent that you’ll go all-in on. By going all-in, you’ll become 10x more capable in that 20 percent, which is highly specific and nuanced, not broad. 你的梦想检查可以指出你关注的方向，并优化自己。它澄清了你的 20%，你将全力以赴。通过全身心投入，你将在这 20%的能力上提高 10 倍，这是高度具体和微妙的，而不是广泛的。

Having a Dream Check also gamifies 10x, making it a fun adventure. 拥有一个梦想检查也游戏 10 倍，使它成为一个有趣的冒险。

Your Dream Check shows you exactly the Unique Ability you are to develop, such that being paid the seemingly unrealistic or absurd amount of money is actually not crazy at all. With the level of Unique Ability you acquire, it actually feels *totally normal and natural* to be paid at that level, even though right now it seems and feels unfathomable. 你的梦想检查显示了你要发展的独特能力，这样得到看似不切实际或荒谬的钱实际上一点也不疯狂。以你获得的特殊能力的水平，它实际上是完全正常和自然的支付，即使现在看起来和感觉是深不可测的。

*What is your Dream Check? 你的梦想支票是什么？*

Michelangelo continued getting bigger and more exciting commissions to do projects that not only resonated with his Unique Ability, but were a profoundly challenging yet exciting opportunity to further develop and expand it. 米开朗琪罗继续得到更大和更令人兴奋的委托，从事项目，不仅与他的独特能力产生共鸣，但这是一个深刻的挑战性和令人兴奋的机会，以进一步发展和扩展它。

For me, my dream check would be being paid $15 million to write a highly niched and specialized book with the right collaborator. Fifteen million dollars is almost exactly 10x the check I’ve been paid to write a book that excited, scared, and energized me. 对我来说，我的梦想支票将是支付 1500 万美元，与合适的合作者一起写一本高度利基和专业的书。1500 万美元几乎是我写一本令我兴奋、害怕、充满活力的书的 10 倍。

Here’s the key question I’d have to ask myself to take my Dream Check seriously: 以下是我必须问自己的关键问题，以认真对待我的梦想检查：

“What kind of value would I need to provide wherein it would be a total no-brainer and extreme bargain to the right person to pay me $15 million to write a book for/with them?” “我需要提供什么样的价值，其中这将是一个完全不用动脑筋和极端讨价还价的合适的人支付我 1500 万美元写一本书/与他们。“

Just being honest about myself. If I were to legitimately be paid $15 million to write a book, a few things would need to be true. For it to make sense, the value would need to be 5–10x the price, so it would need to translate to at least $75–150 million in value. To do that, the book would need to bring that level of positioning and business to the person or organization I’m collaborating with. 只是对自己诚实。如果我能合法地得到 1500 万美元的报酬来写一本书，那么有几件事必须是真的。要想有意义，价值需要是价格的 5- 10 倍，因此至少需要转化为 7500 万至 1.5 亿美元的价值。要做到这一点，这本书需要把这个水平的定位和业务带给我正在合作的人或组织。

If I was collaborating just with a book publisher, that would mean I’d need to sell 5–10 million copies of the book, since each book provides only a few bucks profit for the publisher. This is why celebrities like the Obamas can get a $60 million book deal.^(29) The expectation is that millions of copies will be sold and thus it’s a no-brainer for the publisher. 如果我只是和一家图书出版商合作，那就意味着我需要卖出 500 万到 1000 万册这本书，因为每本书只为出版商提供了几巴克斯的利润。这就是为什么像奥巴马这样的名人可以获得 6000 万美元的图书合同。 ^(29) 预期将售出数百万册，因此出版商无需考虑。

If I was collaborating with a high-end business leader, I might only need to sell a few thousand of the *right* copies. This particular business may charge hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars for their specialized service, and thus, they only need dozens or potentially hundreds of “sales” to make the $15 million investment a no-brainer. 如果我与高端商业领袖合作，我可能只需要卖出几千份合适的拷贝。这个特定的企业可能会收取数十万甚至数百万美元的专业服务，因此，他们只需要几十个或潜在数百个“销售”，使 1500 万美元的投资是不费脑筋的。

This brings us back to fitness function. 这就把我们带回到适应度函数。

It also begs a question Dan encourages you to ask yourself: *Who do you want to be a hero to?* 这也引出了一个问题，丹鼓励你问自己：你想对谁当英雄？

Ask yourself your own version of this question, for it illuminates your fitness function, 20 percent, and the focus of your Unique Ability development. 问问自己这个问题的版本，因为它阐明了你的健身功能，20%，以及你独特能力发展的重点。

First, you define your Dream Check. 首先，你定义你的梦想检查。

This Dream Check should be ballpark 10x what you’ve been paid to this point for a Unique Ability project. This is a massive, even absurd, amount of money to be paid for something that would ultimately be extreme play and transformational for you to do. 这个梦想支票应该是大约 10 倍，你已经支付到这一点为一个独特的能力项目。这是一个巨大的，甚至荒谬的，数额的钱要支付的东西，最终将是极端的发挥和转型为你做。

Then you ask yourself these two questions: 然后你问自己这两个问题：

1.  What specific value would I need to provide such that my Dream Check would be a no-brainer and extreme bargain for the person who would happily pay me? 我需要提供什么样的具体价值，才能让我的梦想支票成为一个很容易的、非常便宜的人谁愿意付钱给我？
2.  What would need to be true of my Unique Ability to be valuable enough that someone would see it as a no-brainer and extreme bargain to write and pay me my Dream Check? 我的特殊能力需要什么才能有足够的价值，以至于有人会把它看作是一种无需思考和极端的交易，写我的梦想支票并支付给我？

In order to provide *that* level of value, you would have to become *10x better and more specific* in your Unique Ability. You’d have to be able to produce *10x value* for the person who wants it—whatever specific results those are. 为了提供这个水平的价值，你必须在你的独特能力上变得更好和更具体。你必须能够为想要它的人创造出 10 倍的价值--无论那些具体的结果是什么。

Who do you want to collaborate with? 你想和谁合作？

Who do you want to create specialized value with and for? 你想和谁一起创造专业价值？

*What kind of Unique Ability would you need to have for you to get that Dream Check? 你需要什么样的异能才能获得梦境支票？*

What specialized skills and abilities and results do you want to create and develop? 你想创造和发展哪些专业技能、能力和成果？

10x is about *better*, not bigger. 10 x 是关于更好，而不是更大。

Hence, to get your Dream Check, you’d *become 10x better and more valuable* in some unique and specific way to *whomever you want to be a hero to*. 因此，为了得到你的梦想检查，你会变得 10 倍更好，更有价值的一些独特和特定的方式，任何你想成为英雄的人。

What would your 20 percent be—where you’d go all-in to further master your Unique Ability and transform yourself into the kind of person where getting that Dream Check isn’t just crazy, but feels completely natural? 你的 20%会是什么？你会全力以赴，进一步掌握你的独特能力，把自己转变成那种得到梦想检查不仅是疯狂的，而且感觉完全自然的人？

If the idea of “Dream Check” doesn’t resonate with you—then think of some specific mountain top or peak experience that does. For example, maybe you want to have some year-round family trip, or finish an ultra-marathon in a particular time, or complete some other massive achievement or adventure that is far more relevant and important to you than money. 如果“梦想检查”的想法不能引起你的共鸣，那么想想一些特定的山顶或高峰体验。例如，也许你想进行一次全年的家庭旅行，或者在某个特定时间完成一场超级马拉松，或者完成其他一些重大成就或冒险，这些成就或冒险对你来说比金钱更重要。

The point is: Is this a 10x adventure that would also develop your Unique Ability and transform your life? 重点是：这是一个 10 倍的冒险，也会发展你的独特能力和改变你的生活吗？

Is this what you most want to do, regardless of what other people think? 这是你最想做的事，不管别人怎么想？

## Chapter Takeaways 第四章要点

*   Many high achievers are prone to being in “the gap,” wherein they constantly measure themselves and their experiences against unreachable ideals. This makes them feel terrible and unsuccessful, regardless of what they’ve achieved. 许多成功者往往处于“差距”中，他们不断地用遥不可及的理想来衡量自己和自己的经历。这让他们感到糟糕和不成功，不管他们取得了什么成就。
*   Ideals are like a horizon in the desert. They provide illumination and direction but are unreachable. No matter how many steps you take toward the horizon, it will continually move out of reach. Ideals are the same. They are useful for direction, but you shouldn’t measure yourself against them. 理想就像沙漠中的地平线。他们提供光明和方向，但无法到达。无论你朝地平线走了多少步，它都会不断地移动到遥不可及的地方。理想是一样的。它们对指导很有用，但你不应该拿它们来衡量自己。
*   Being in the gain is a twofold concept that enables you to effectively measure your progress and transform every experience you have into greater learning, meaning, and growth. 获得是一个双重的概念，它使你能够有效地衡量你的进步，并将你拥有的每一个经验转化为更大的学习、意义和成长。
*   To be in the gain, you only measure your progress backward against where you were before. You never measure yourself against anything external—whether that be your own ideals or other people. 为了获得收益，你只会根据你以前的位置来衡量你的进步。你永远不要拿外在的东西来衡量自己，不管是你自己的理想还是别人。
*   If you’re living in “the gap,” then going for 10x growth will be a nightmare for you and everyone around you. Firstly, you won’t recognize, value, or appreciate the progress you’re making along the way, since you’ll be measuring yourself against continually moving and unreachable ideals. Secondly, being in the gap alienates you from those around you, making life a drag and “success” an impossibility for them and you. Third, without transforming every experience you have along the way into learning and growth, you won’t continually get 10x better and more unique, which is what 10x is fundamentally all about. 如果你生活在“差距”中，那么 10 倍的增长将是你和你周围的人的噩梦。首先，你不会认识到、重视或欣赏你一路上所取得的进步，因为你会用不断移动和遥不可及的理想来衡量自己。其次，处于差距会让你与周围的人疏远，让生活变得拖沓，让“成功”对他们和你来说都是不可能的。第三，如果不把你的每一个经历转化为学习和成长，你就不会不断地获得 10 倍的更好和更独特，这就是 10 倍的根本意义。
*   People tend to have an inflated aversion to loss, which can make letting go of your 80 percent feel painful. However, when you see it properly from a gain perspective, you realize that letting go of your 80 percent—whatever that may be—is actually a huge gain! Letting go of something that’s no longer serving you is a massive step forward! 人们对失去的厌恶情绪往往会膨胀，这会让你放弃 80%的东西感到痛苦。然而，当你从收益的角度正确看待它时，你会意识到放弃你的 80%--不管是什么--实际上是一个巨大的收益！放弃那些不再为你服务的东西是一个巨大的进步！
*   One application of a “gain” mindset is reviewing your previous 10x jumps. In so doing, you can also clarify the 20 percent of each stage, as well as the 80 percent you powerfully let go of. 一种“增益”心态的应用是回顾你以前的 10 倍跳跃。这样做，你也可以澄清每个阶段的 20%，以及你有力地放弃的 80%。
*   By reflecting on your previous jumps and “connecting the dots backward,” you’ll firstly see that you’ve gone 10x many times before. This will normalize 10x for you, helping you see that you can continue going 10x in the future, as you have in the past. Additionally, in examining the 20 percent of each 10x jump, you’ll be able to see and appreciate how you’ve been developing your Unique Ability to this point. 通过反思你以前的跳跃和“连接点向后”，你会首先看到你已经跑了 10 倍很多次。这将为您正常化 10 x，帮助您看到您可以继续在未来使用 10 x，就像您在过去一样。此外，在检查每 10 倍跳跃的 20%时，你将能够看到并欣赏到你是如何发展你的独特能力到这一点。
*   Accurately and powerfully measuring your progress backward enables you to more fully understand and appreciate your own past. This also helps you better clarify and contextualize your future—the non-linear 10x jumps you now feel most excited and ready to make. 准确而有力地衡量你的进步可以让你更全面地理解和欣赏你自己的过去。这也有助于你更好地阐明和理解你的未来--非线性的 10 倍跳跃你现在感到最兴奋和准备去做。
*   In reflecting on your next 10x jump, one helpful concept is called fitness function—which asks the question: What are you optimizing for? Fitness function clarifies the *qualities you want to develop* and the *standards by which you measure* progress and success. Whatever you focus on you become. 在思考你的下一次 10 倍跳跃时，一个有用的概念叫做健身函数，它问了这样一个问题：你在优化什么？健身功能阐明了你想要培养的素质以及衡量进步和成功的标准。无论你专注于什么，你都会成为什么。
*   Think about your “Dream Check”—a 10x level opportunity that someone in the future will happily pay you because you’ve become that uniquely valuable. 想想你的“梦想支票”--一个 10 倍的机会，未来有人会很高兴地支付给你，因为你已经变得如此有价值。
*   What would your Unique Ability need to involve—in terms of capability and results—to attract your *10x Dream Check*? 你的独特能力需要涉及什么--在能力和结果方面--来吸引你的 10 倍梦想支票？
