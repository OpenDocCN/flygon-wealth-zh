*“If we want to live a Wholehearted life, we have to become intentional about cultivating sleep and play, and about letting go of exhaustion as a status symbol.” “如果我们想过一种全心全意的生活，我们必须有意识地培养睡眠和玩耍，放弃疲惫作为身份象征。”*

**— BRENÉ BROWN^(1) - BRENÉ BROWN ^(1)**

In the knowledge working and digital world we now live in, the traditional 9 to 5 workday is poorly structured for high productivity. Although this may be obvious given people’s mediocre performance, addiction to stimulants, lack of engagement, and the fact that most people hate their jobs, it’s impossible to ignore the evidence. 在我们现在生活的知识工作和数字化世界中，传统的朝九晚五的工作日结构不佳，无法实现高生产力。尽管考虑到人们的表现平庸、对兴奋剂上瘾、缺乏参与感以及大多数人讨厌自己的工作，这一点可能是显而易见的，但我们不可能忽视这些证据。

The entrepreneurs who make the fastest and biggest 10x jumps escape the soul-sucking corporate or bureaucratic model of time. 最快、最大的 10 倍跳跃的企业家逃离了令人窒息的企业或官僚时代模式。

This bureaucratic model of time is how children are trained in the public education system of the 21st century and is based on the organizational and factory systems of the early 20th century. When students come out of the 9–5-style public education system, most of them are then funneled into corporate jobs that are based on the same premise of time. 这种官僚化的时间模式是儿童在 21 世纪的公共教育系统中如何被训练的，并且是基于 20 世纪初的组织和工厂系统。当学生们从朝九晚五的公共教育体系中走出来时，他们中的大多数人随后会进入基于相同时间前提的公司工作。

The emphasis of a quantitative model of time is filling time with menial tasks and effort. The emphasis is not on creativity, innovation, and *results*. 时间定量模型的重点是用琐碎的任务和努力填满时间。重点不是创造力、创新和结果。

As Seth Godin explains, “Every year, we churn out millions of workers who are trained to do 1925-style labor.”^(2) 正如 Seth Godin 所解释的那样，“每年，我们都培养出数以百万计的工人，他们接受过 1925 年的劳动训练。 ^(2)

To go 10x, you approach time *qualitatively*, not quantitatively. This is actually what Einstein’s relatively theories are based on and it’s a more accurate view of time than the outdated and mechanical Newtonian models. 要达到 10 倍，你是定性的，而不是定量的。这实际上是爱因斯坦相对理论的基础，它是一个更准确的时间观，比过时的，机械的牛顿模型。

Newtonian time, which is inaccurate, views time as *abstract, fixed,* and *linear*—the past is behind us, the present is now, and the future is in front of us. Newtonian time also views time in *absolute* terms, meaning time is the *same for everyone,* everywhere, and in every situation. Twenty-four hours for you is the same as 24 hours for me.^(3) 牛顿的时间是不准确的，它认为时间是抽象的、固定的、线性的过去在我们身后，现在在现在，未来在我们面前。牛顿的时间也是绝对的时间观，这意味着时间对每个人、任何地方、任何情况都是一样的。你的 24 小时和我的 24 小时一样。 ^(3)

Einstein’s relativity theories of time, in addition to modern research in psychology and neuroscience, shatter Newtonian views of time, providing a much more compelling and transformational approach to time. 爱因斯坦的相对论时间理论，加上心理学和神经科学的现代研究，打破了牛顿的时间观，提供了一个更引人注目和变革的时间方法。

Einstein time is *subjective, qualitative, non-linear,* and *flexible,* not fixed. Put simply, time is *not the same* from one situation to another, nor from one perspective to another.^(4) 爱因斯坦的时间是主观的、定性的、非线性的、灵活的，不是固定的。简而言之，时间从一种情况到另一种情况，从一个角度到另一个情况，时间是不一样的。 ^(4)

No two people are having the same experience of time. 没有两个人对时间的体验是一样的。

Twenty-four hours for me and 24 hours for you are *not the same*. 我的 24 小时和你的 24 小时不一样。

Time expands or contracts based on the speed and distance an object moves through space in a given direction. The faster an object moves, the *slower the times goes* for that object relative to other objects. *Time dilation* is the term describing the “slowing down” of time as an object increases in velocity through space. 时间根据物体在给定方向上在空间中移动的速度和距离而膨胀或收缩。对象移动得越快，该对象相对于其他对象的时间就越慢。时间膨胀是描述当物体在空间中的速度增加时时间的“减慢”的术语。

The more you can experience in a given amount of time, the further you’ve traveled and the more your time has dilated or stretched. As entrepreneur and innovator Peter Diamandis said, “The faster you go, the slower time passes, the longer you live.” 在给定的时间内，你能经历的越多，你走的越远，你的时间就越扩张或伸展。正如企业家和创新家彼得·迪亚曼迪斯所说：“你走得越快，时间过得越慢，你活得越久。

In the 1800s, many pioneers spent *8-12 months* walking across the plains pulling handcarts to get from the East to the West of the United States. Today, you can *cover the same distance in 4-6 hours* on an airplane. Thus, we have essentially dilated time by multiples in the thousands by covering the same distance in a fraction of the time. 在 19 世纪，许多拓荒者花了 8-12 个月的时间拉着手推车穿越平原，从美国东部到西部。今天，您可以在飞机上 4-6 小时内完成相同的距离。因此，我们基本上通过在一小部分时间内覆盖相同的距离，以数千倍的倍数扩展了时间。

The ancient Greeks had two words for time: *kairos* and *chronos*.^(5,6) While *chronos* refers to chronological or sequential time, *kairos* signifies a period or season, a moment of indeterminate time in which an event of significance happens. 古希腊人用两个词来形容时间：凯罗斯和克罗诺斯。 ^(5,6) 虽然 chronos 指的是按时间顺序或顺序的时间，kairos 指的是一个时期或季节，是一个不确定的时刻，其中发生了一个重要事件。

*Chrono*s is quantitative. 克罗诺斯是定量的。

*Kairos* has a *qualitative*, permanent nature. Kairos 有一个定性的，永久的性质。

*Kairos* is an ancient Greek word meaning the right or opportune moment. *Kairos* is what many philosophers and mystics would refer to as “deep time” or “alive time.” In *kairos-*time, the world seems to stop entirely. It can be measured in long exhales, a shared laugh, a colorful sunset, a courageous moment. It is qualitative time where you move forward in the present, untethered by any moving clock or calendar. Kairos 是一个古希腊词，意思是正确的或适当的时刻。Kairos 是许多哲学家和神秘主义者所称的“深度时间”或“活着的时间”。在凯罗斯时代，世界似乎完全停止了。它可以用长长的呼气、共同的笑声、多彩的日落、勇敢的时刻来衡量。这是一个定性的时间，你在当下前进，不受任何移动的时钟或日历的束缚。

A transformation has occurred. 发生了转变。

Distance of either meaning or progress occurred. 无论是意义还是进步的距离都发生了。

When you embrace *kairos* or relative time, you stop drawing fine lines of separation between the past, present, and future. Rather than time being sequential and literal, time becomes wholistic, flexible, and transformative.^(7) As Einstein is attributed with writing, “People like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”^(8) 当你拥抱 kairos 或相对时间时，你不再在过去、现在和未来之间画出细微的界限。时间不再是顺序的和字面的，而是变得整体的，灵活的和变革的。爱因斯坦写道：“像我们这样相信物理学的人都知道，过去、现在和未来之间的区别只是一种顽固持久的幻觉。 ^(8)

If you’re in *kairos*, you can tap into higher levels of being, connection, and inspiration. If you’re in *chronos*, time will pass you by. You’ll be caught in paralysis-by-analysis or busyness but not real movement. 如果你在凯罗斯，你可以挖掘到更高层次的存在，联系和灵感。如果你在时空里，时间会和你擦肩而过。你会陷入瘫痪的分析或忙碌，但不是真实的的运动。

The University of Chicago professor and theologian William Schweikert described *kairos* as “A moment in which we can deploy our greatest powers to humane purposes or allow this moment to swallow hopes and ideals.”^(9) 芝加哥大学教授兼神学家威廉·施韦克特（William Schweikert）将凯罗斯描述为“一个我们可以将我们最大的力量用于人道目的的时刻，或者允许这一时刻吞噬希望和理想。 ^(9)

*Chronos*-time passes whether you’re conscious or not. But *kairos-*time can only be experienced when you’re fully absorbed in the moment. The more you live in *kairos*, the more in flow you’ll be. The more peak experiences you’ll have. The more awe, self-expansion, and meaning you’ll experience. 时空不管你有没有意识，时间都会流逝。但是凯罗斯时间只有当你完全沉浸在当下时才能体验到。你在凯罗斯住得越多，你就越能进入流动状态。你就会有更多的巅峰体验。你会体验到更多的敬畏、自我扩张和意义。

A few moments in *kairos* will advance and transform you more than a lifetime of *chronos*. 在凯罗斯的几分钟会比在计时器上度过一辈子更能让你进步和改变。

For the remainder of this chapter, you’ll learn to approach time qualitatively. You’ll learn a *kairos*-based time system Dan developed years ago to enable entrepreneurs to stretch and transform their experience of time and achieve *time freedom*. 在本章的剩余部分，你将学习如何定性地处理时间。您将学习 Dan 多年前开发的基于 kairos 的时间系统，使企业家能够扩展和改变他们的时间体验，实现时间自由。

You’ll learn to transform yourself more in a day than you previously did in a decade. 你将学会在一天之内改变自己，而不是你之前在十年内所做的。

Your time will slow down, and you’ll become more still and present. Your time will also slow down because you’ll advance toward your 10x dreams far more quickly while being far less busy. 你的时间会慢下来，你会变得更加安静和当下。你的时间也会变慢，因为你会更快地朝着你的 10 倍梦想前进，而不那么忙碌。

Advancement is *kairos*. 进步是 kairos。

Busy is *chronos*. 忙碌就是计时器。

Let’s begin. 我们开始吧.

## Become a 10x Performer: Free Days, Focus Days, Buffer Days 成为 10 倍表演者：空闲天数、焦点天数、缓冲天数

*“Most people don’t have boundaries in their time system. The majority of entrepreneurs have the attitude that any one of the 365 days in a year can be a workday if there’s an opportunity. Their mindsets practically guarantee that work is always going to be favored over anything in their lives—and everyone in their lives. But when you structure your time according to The Entrepreneurial Time System of Free, Focus, and Buffer Days, you have the freedom to make and carry out all your commitments, personal and professional.” “大多数人在他们的时间系统中没有界限。大多数企业家的态度是，如果有机会，一年 365 天中的任何一天都可以成为工作日。他们的思维模式实际上保证了工作总是比他们生活中的任何事情更重要，甚至比他们生活中的每一个人都重要。但是，当你按照自由、专注和缓冲日的创业时间系统来安排你的时间时，你就可以自由地做出和执行你所有的承诺，无论是个人的还是专业的。*

**— DAN SULLIVAN - 丹·苏利文**

In his 20s, Dan was an actor working in the entertainment business. He learned that the actors and entertainers designated a different type of task to complete each day. For example, on *performance days*, entertainers gave 100 percent energy and effort into their performance—such as acting in a play, shooting the scenes of a movie, or as an athlete, playing the actual game. 20 多岁时，丹是一名在娱乐业工作的演员。他了解到演员和艺人每天指定不同类型的任务来完成。例如，在表演日，艺人们将 100%的精力和精力投入到他们的表演中，比如在戏剧中表演，拍摄电影的场景，或者作为一名运动员，进行实际的比赛。

Every aspect of the entertainer’s work and time was to give increasingly valuable performances that people would pay for. 艺人的工作和时间的每一个方面都是为了给予越来越有价值的表演，人们会付钱。

The actual length of a particular performance wasn’t very long—maybe 3-4 hours max such as a football game, concert, or filming day. 一场演出的实际时长并不长，最多可能 3-4 个小时，比如足球赛、音乐会或拍摄日。

As the performer develops increasingly rare levels of mastery in their craft, they are paid exponentially higher and higher amounts of money for their performances. Payment is for unique value and performance—i.e., leverage—not time and effort. 随着表演者在技艺上的掌握程度越来越高，他们的表演报酬也越来越高。付款是针对独特的价值和性能-即，杠杆-而不是时间和精力。

Dan found that there are fundamentally three different types of days for entertainers, which enable them to create higher and higher valued performances: 丹发现，艺人基本上有三种不同类型的日子，这使他们能够创造出越来越高价值的表演：

1.  Performance days 演出天数
2.  Practice or rehearsal days 练习或排练日
3.  Rejuvenation days 返老还童天数

**On *practice or rehearsal days***, the entertainers practice and hone their performances so that they can give increasingly valuable performances when the spotlight turns on. 在练习或排练日，艺人们练习和磨练他们的表演，以便他们可以在聚光灯打开时给予越来越有价值的表演。

*“We talking bout practice?”* the NBA star, Allen Iverson, once asked in frustration to a reporter who questioned his continual absence at team practices. “我们在谈练习？“NBA 星星艾伦曾经沮丧地问一位记者，他质疑他经常缺席球队训练。

Yes, Allen, *we talking ’bout practice.* 是的，艾伦，我们在说练习。

Those who take full advantage of their preparation days experience dramatic rises in results on their performance days, while those who don’t practice plummet in their performances. 那些充分利用准备日的人在表演日的成绩显著上升，而那些不练习的人在表演日的成绩直线下降。

Consider the difference between two NBA stars, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokić and Los Angeles Lakers center Anthony Davis. 考虑一下两个 NBA 球星之间的差异，丹佛掘金中锋尼古拉·约基奇和洛杉矶湖人中锋安东尼·戴维斯。

During the 2019–2020 season, both players were ranked among the top 10 players of the entire NBA. That season, the Nuggets played the Lakers in the playoffs and Davis totally outclassed Jokić. The Lakers dominated the Nuggets and went on to win the championship that year. Davis seemed to be ascending to new peaks in his abilities. 在 2019-2020 赛季，两名球员都跻身整个 NBA 前十名球员之列。那个赛季，掘金在季后赛对阵湖人，戴维斯完全超越了约基奇。湖人队统治了掘金队，并在那一年赢得了总冠军。戴维斯的能力似乎正在上升到一个新的高峰。

Yet, just two years later, it’s mind-bending *how much* better Jokić had become and similarly mind-blowing *how much* worse Davis had become. 然而，仅仅两年后，Jokić变得多么好，同样令人震惊的是戴维斯变得多么糟糕。

Jokić developed several sides of his game he previously didn’t have, such as his improved shooting ability and defense. He went from already being one of the best players in the world to making a *quantum leap* to another stratosphere of performance, showing that no matter how great you already are, there are several more levels you could go, if you apply the 10x process. 约基奇发展了他以前没有的几个方面，例如他的投篮能力和防守能力的提高。他从已经是世界上最好的球员之一，到了另一个性能的飞跃，这表明无论你已经有多棒，如果你应用 10 倍的过程，你还可以去几个级别。

Davis obviously has been caught-up in the 80 percent and became 2x. After winning the championship, it’s as though he stopped having a 10x future to stretch him. He stopped applying the power of kairos performance time—wherein he leveraged more practice and performance days and embraced his rejuvenation or recovery days. He was plagued by injuries and a lack of motivation. 戴维斯显然已经被抓住在 80%，成为 2x。在赢得冠军之后，他就好像不再有 10 倍的未来来拉伸他。他不再使用 kairos 的表演时间，他利用更多的练习和表演时间，拥抱他的恢复或恢复时间。他受到伤病和缺乏动力的困扰。

His *chronos*-time is speeding up because his *kairos*-progress is slowing down. 他的时空加速了，因为他的凯罗斯进程正在减慢。

When you’re not making big progress, time speeds up for you. The years pass by and you aren’t really going anywhere. Conversely, when you are transforming and making huge progress, your time dilates and slows down. You advance and transform more in a year than is normal for a decade. 当你没有取得很大的进步时，时间对你来说会加速。岁月流逝，你真的无处可去。相反，当你正在转变并取得巨大进步时，你的时间会膨胀并减慢。你在一年内的进步和转变比正常的十年多。

In *kairos*-time, you’re operating with different rules than those in *chronos*-time. It’s not even comparable. 在凯罗斯时间里，你的操作规则与在计时时间里的操作规则不同。根本就没有可比性。

As a performer, if you utilize your practice and rejuvenation days, your performance days will take on increasingly rare quality and value. Your qualitative time will translate to qualitative Unique Ability and performance. As a result, you will continually 10x your freedom of time, money, relationship, and purpose. 作为一个表演者，如果你利用你的练习和恢复活力的日子，你的表演日子将采取越来越罕见的质量和价值。你的定性时间将转化为定性的独特能力和表现。因此，你将不断地 10 倍于你的时间、金钱、关系和目标的自由。

**The final type of day for an entertainer is rejuvenation days** where the entertainer takes a break to rest and recover. The definition of the word *rejuvenation* is “to make young or youthful again: to give new vigor to.” Rejuvenation is about making yourself, your enthusiasm, your excitement, and your ambitions young again. 艺人的最后一种日子是返老还童日，艺人需要休息和恢复。年轻化一词的定义是“使年轻或再次年轻化：给予新的活力”复兴就是让你自己、你的热情、你的兴奋和你的野心再次年轻。

When new entrepreneurs join Strategic Coach, most are operating on the industrial or 9–5 model of time where they are busy but not productive. They’re overly aware of everything going on in their business and overly managing their team. They’re in *chronos*-time and they’re not making massive progress. They’re 2x at best. 当新的企业家加入 Strategic Coach 时，大多数人都是在工业模式或朝九晚五模式下运作，他们很忙碌，但效率不高。他们对业务中发生的一切都过于敏感，对团队的管理也过于严格。他们处于时空中，他们没有取得巨大的进步。最多是 2x。

They are focused on linear time and effort. They’re not continually freeing themselves up to hone their vision, creativity, and results. 他们专注于线性时间和努力。他们没有不断地释放自己来磨练自己的远见、创造力和成果。

Dan helps his entrepreneurs shift to a qualitative and non-linear model of time, where they’re focused on creating increasingly powerful results with less time and effort: more *kairos*-time. Dan 帮助他的企业家们转向定性和非线性的时间模型，他们专注于用更少的时间和精力创造越来越强大的结果：更多的凯罗斯时间

In order to create 10x non-linear results, these entrepreneurs need to transform themselves. To help them do that, Dan encourages them to upgrade and segment their time like a world-class entertainer would, where they are continually optimizing around higher and higher performances. The objective is to get increasingly larger checks for the same amount of work. 为了创造 10 倍的非线性成果，这些企业家需要自我改造。为了帮助他们做到这一点，Dan 鼓励他们像世界级的艺人一样升级和细分他们的时间，在那里他们不断优化越来越高的表演。目标是为同样的工作量获得越来越大的支票。

An entrepreneur may be making $500 per day when they are focused and performing. But over time, they can jump to $5,000 per day, then $50,000, and even $500,000+. 当一个企业家专注和表现时，他们可能每天赚 500 美元。但随着时间的推移，他们可以跳到每天 5，000 美元，然后是 50，000 美元，甚至是 500，000 美元以上。

Just think about yourself: *Have you 10xed the value and price of your best performances—even if the amount of time working technically didn’t change?* 想想你自己：你是否已经调整了你最佳表现的价值和价格--即使工作时间在技术上没有改变？

If you want to 10x the quality and value of your performance, you’ll need to transform how you approach your time. Nineteenth-century factory worker and *chronos-*time won’t do. Being busy isn’t how you become world-class. 如果你想把你的表现质量和价值提高 10 倍，你需要改变你处理时间的方式。19 世纪的工厂工人和计时器是不行的。忙碌不是你成为世界级的原因。

You’ve got to approach time qualitatively and non-linearly—where you’re increasingly freeing yourself up to transform yourself, your perspectives, your vision, your insights, and your relationships. 你必须以质的和非线性的方式来接近时间--在那里，你越来越多地解放自己来改变自己，改变你的观点，改变你的愿景，改变你的洞察力，改变你的关系。

Dan has reframed the three “entertainer days” to the following: 丹将三个“艺人日”重新定义为以下内容：

1.  Free Days (rejuvenation days) 免费天数（复兴天数）
2.  Focus Days (performance days) 焦点日（绩效日）
3.  Buffer Days (organization and preparation days) 缓冲天数（组织和准备天数）

## Free Days Part 1: Make Recovery Your First Priority 第一部分：把恢复作为您的第一要务

At the beginning of every calendar year, Babs fills in all the Free Days (180 days) on Dan’s calendar before anything else. Those are non-negotiable. Nothing gets in the way of that. 在每个日历年开始的时候，Babs 都会在丹的日历上填上所有的空闲日（180 天）。这些是没有商量余地的。没有什么能阻挡你的脚步。

The more successful you become, the more recovery takes the front seat to *everything* else. Research shows that recovery is essential for flow and increased high performance.^(10,11,12,13,14,15) 你越成功，就越能恢复所有事情。研究表明，恢复对于流动和提高高性能至关重要。 ^(10,11,12,13,14,15)

For example, LeBron James is notorious for the investment he’s put into his body—millions of dollars annually—which has enabled him to play at an elite level for longer than any basketball player in history. He’s also known for sleeping at minimum 8-10 hours per day, and often upward of 12 hours per day. Tim Ferriss once interviewed LeBron James and Mike Mancias, LeBron’s long-time (over 15 years) athletic trainer and recovery specialist. 例如，勒布朗·詹姆斯因投入身体的投入而声名狼借--每年投入数百万美元--这使他能够在精英水平上打球的时间比历史上任何一位篮球运动员都长。他还以每天至少 8-10 小时的睡眠而闻名，通常每天 12 小时以上。蒂姆·费里斯曾经采访过勒布朗·詹姆斯和迈克·曼西亚斯，他是勒布朗的长期（超过 15 年）运动教练和康复专家。

The first question Tim asked in the interview, speaking to both LeBron and Mike, but ultimately directed at Mike, focused on recovery: 蒂姆在采访中问的第一个问题，对勒布朗和迈克都说了，但最终是针对迈克的，重点是恢复：

“Mike, I’d love to dig into recovery and injury prevention. . . LeBron, you’re a bit of a unicorn in the sense that you’ve played more than, as I understand it, 50,000 minutes in your career. Most hit a wall and deteriorate after 40,000\. So, you’re defying all the predictions of player decline. So, Mike, maybe you can give us a window into some of that. Could you walk us through some of the tools of the trade and the approaches that you use to help with recovery in between games?”^(16) “迈克，我很想深入研究恢复和预防伤害。. .勒布朗，你有点独角兽，因为你在职业生涯中打了超过 50，000 分钟。大多数人在 4 万人后碰壁并恶化。所以，你违背了所有关于玩家衰退的预测。迈克，也许你能给予我们一个机会。你能告诉我们一些交易的工具和方法，你用来帮助恢复比赛之间？“ ^(16)

Mike replied: 麦克回答道：

“I think with any elite athlete the one thing that we all, as trainers and therapists, have to keep in mind is that recovery never ends. Recovery never stops. If LeBron plays 40 minutes one night, if he plays 28 minutes one night, we’re still going to keep recovery as our number one focus, whether that be in nutrition, whether that be in hydration, more flexibility exercises, stuff in the weight room. It’s a never-ending process, really. And I think that’s the approach that we must take in order for us to be successful and provide longevity for these guys.” “我认为，对于任何优秀运动员来说，作为教练和治疗师，我们都必须记住的一件事是，恢复永远不会结束。复苏从未停止。如果勒布朗一个晚上打 40 分钟，如果他一个晚上打 28 分钟，我们仍然会把恢复作为我们的第一重点，无论是营养，无论是水合，更多的灵活性锻炼，举重室的东西。这是一个永无止境的过程，真的。我认为这是我们必须采取的方法，以便我们取得成功，并为这些人提供长寿。“

Recovery is crucial for being fresh, operating at your best, as well as career and life longevity. 恢复对于保持新鲜，以最佳状态运作，以及职业生涯和寿命至关重要。

There’s now an entire subsection of occupational psychology growing around the importance of work-recovery called *psychological detachment from work*.^(17,18,19,20) True psychological detachment occurs when you completely refrain from work-related activities as well as obsessive thoughts during nonwork time. 现在，职业心理学中有一个完整的分支围绕着工作恢复的重要性而发展，称为心理脱离工作。真正的心理分离发生在你完全避免与工作有关的活动以及在非工作时间的强迫性想法。

Research has found that people who psychologically detach from work experience: 研究发现，心理上脱离工作经验的人：

*   Less work-related fatigue and procrastination.^(21) 减少与工作有关的疲劳和拖延。 ^(21)
*   Increased physical health and increased *engagement* (vigor, dedication, and flow) at work, especially during highly demanding times.^(22) 增强身体健康和增加工作投入（活力，奉献和流动），特别是在高要求的时期。 ^(22)
*   Greater marital satisfaction even with a heavy workload.^(23) 即使在繁重的工作量下，婚姻满意度也会更高。 ^(23)
*   Increased overall quality of life.^(24) 提高整体生活质量。 ^(24)
*   Greater mental health.^(25) 更好的心理健康。 ^(25)

If you’re never fully unplugged, you’re also never in the zone. 如果你从来没有完全拔下电源，你也从来没有在这个区域。

Your ability to turn 100 percent “on” and work in a flow state is in equal proportion to your ability to turn 100 percent “off” and fully release and let go. 你能百分百“打开”并在心流状态下工作的能力，和你能百分百“关闭”并完全释放和放手的能力是相等的。

Focus is contraction. 专注是收缩。

Recovery is expansion. 复苏就是扩张。

To achieve flow and higher performance, you want to engage in *active recovery* activities that also generate flow.^(26) For instance, LeBron’s recovery isn’t just sitting on the couch, although I’m sure he does a lot of that as well. Massage, compression, hot tubs, sauna, cold plunges, and other forms of therapy. How you do anything is how you do everything. If you want 10x better flow and performance and work, you’ll want 10x better and more restorative recovery. 为了实现流动和更高的性能，您需要参与同时产生流动的主动恢复活动。例如，勒布朗的恢复不仅仅是坐在沙发上，尽管我相信他也做了很多。按摩、按压、热水浴缸、桑拿浴、冷浴和其他形式的治疗。你怎么做事就是你怎么做事。如果你想要 10 倍的流量、性能和工作，你需要 10 倍的更好和更好的恢复。

10x is about *quality*, more than quantity. 10 x 是关于质量，而不是数量。

Quality in *all things*—your standards in all *important* (i.e., 10x) things evolve. The nutrition and food in your body. The quality of your sleep and environment. The quality of your recovery. The quality of your experiences—including peak and novel experiences that are purely for fun and connection. 质量在所有的事情-您的标准在所有重要的（即，10 x）事情发展。你体内的营养和食物。你的睡眠质量和环境。你康复的质量。你体验的质量-包括纯粹为了乐趣和联系而进行的高峰和新奇体验。

The ultimate form of healing and therapy is healthy and close relationships. Creating more meaningful and playful connections with those who are most important to you. 治疗和治疗的最终形式是健康和亲密的关系。与那些对你最重要的人建立更有意义和有趣的联系。

Given that my work is mostly mental and relational—reading books, having conversations, and writing—physical activity, such as heavy weight-training and even long walks are amazing active recovery for me. Not only does it give my mind a rest, but increasing my fitness increases the blood flow to my brain. The quality of my work always increases after active recovery. 考虑到我的工作主要是心理和人际关系阅读书籍，交谈，写作体育活动，如负重训练，甚至是长距离散步，对我来说都是惊人的积极恢复。它不仅给予我的大脑得到休息，而且增加我的健康增加了血液流向我的大脑。我的工作质量总是提高后积极恢复。

## Free Days Part 2: Higher Stakes Means You Need More Space 第二部分：更高的赌注意味着你需要更多的空间

With growing success and mastery, recovery becomes increasingly important because the decisions you make at higher levels have 10x or 10,000x the impact and consequence your previous decisions did. As Naval Ravikant said, “In an age of infinite leverage, judgement is the most important skill.” 随着越来越多的成功和掌握，恢复变得越来越重要，因为你在更高层次上所做的决定所产生的影响和后果是你以前的决定的 10 倍或 10，000 倍。正如海军 Ravikant 所说，“在一个杠杆无限的时代，判断力是最重要的技能。

The more leverage and influence behind your actions, the more judgement and discernment matter. 你行动背后的杠杆和影响力越大，判断和辨别力就越重要。

Sound judgment and thinking through bigger and more complex challenges or opportunities require more brain power, more time, more fermentation. You can’t do this if you’re always busy at work. You can’t do this by jumping from task to task. 通过更大、更复杂的挑战或机遇进行正确的判断和思考，需要更多的脑力、更多的时间、更多的发酵。如果你总是忙碌工作，你就不能这样做。你不能通过从一个任务跳到另一个任务来做到这一点。

Being busy is 2x. 忙碌是 2x。

It speeds time up with little transformation in between. 它加快了时间，其间几乎没有变化。

One study found that only 16 percent of respondents reported getting creative insight while at work.^(27) Ideas generally came while the person was at home or in transportation, or during recreational activity. “The most creative ideas aren’t going to come while sitting in front of your monitor,” says Scott Birnbaum, a vice president of Samsung Semiconductor. 一项研究发现，只有 16%的受访者表示在工作中获得了创造性的洞察力。 ^(27) 想法通常是在人们在家或在交通工具上，或在娱乐活动中产生的。三星半导体副总裁斯科特·伯恩鲍姆说：“最有创意的想法不会出现在你的显示器前。”

When you’re working directly on a task, your mind is tightly focused on the problem at hand (i.e., direct reflection). Conversely, when you’re not working and fully recovering, your mind loosely wanders (i.e., indirect reflection). 当你直接在一项任务上工作时，你的思想会紧紧地集中在手头的问题上（即，直接反射）。相反，当你没有工作和完全恢复时，你的思想松散地徘徊（即，间接反射）。

While driving or doing some form of recreation, the external stimuli in your environment (like the buildings or landscapes around you) subconsciously prompt memories and other thoughts. Because your mind is wandering both contextually (on different subjects) and temporally between past, present, and future, your brain will make distant and distinct connections related to the problem you’re trying to solve (eureka!). 在开车或做某种形式的娱乐活动时，环境中的外部刺激（如周围的建筑物或风景）潜意识地促使记忆和其他想法。因为你的思维在过去、现在和未来之间徘徊（在不同的主题上）和时间上，你的大脑将与你试图解决的问题建立遥远而明确的联系（尤里卡！）.

Creativity and innovation are about making unique and sometimes distant connections. This involves new and interesting inputs as well as the indirect reflection and fermentation process that can only happen when you have space and time. 创造力和创新是关于建立独特的，有时是遥远的联系。这涉及新的和有趣的输入，以及间接的反思和发酵过程，只有当你有空间和时间时才能发生。

As David Keith Lynch explained in his book *Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity*, ideas and opportunities are like fish.^(28) If you stay at the surface level, you will only be aware of the small fish. It is only by going deep into the water that you catch the big fish. 正如大卫·基思·林奇（David Keith Lynch）在他的书《捉大鱼》（Catching the Big Fish）中所说：冥想、意识和创造力、想法和机会就像鱼一样。 ^(28) 如果你停留在水面上，你只会注意到小鱼。只有深入水里，你才能钓到大鱼。

Being busy is staying at the surface. 忙碌是停留在表面。

To find big ideas, you need lots of free time. But also, higher quality time. 要找到伟大的想法，你需要大量的空闲时间。更高质量的时间。

Lots of time where you’re rested, relaxed, and open. 有很多时间让你休息，放松，开放。

This is one fundamental reason why recovery is so essential. Your best and most innovative ideas will occur while you’re unplugged from the busyness of work and able to really expand and contract your thinking—going hyper-micro and hyper-macro—expanding the vision, coming up with new ideas, etc. 这是复苏如此重要的一个根本原因。你最好和最具创新性的想法会出现在你摆脱工作的忙碌，能够真正扩展和收缩你的思维--去超微观和超宏观--扩展视野，提出新的想法等等。

This is how Bill Gates famously got most of the big ideas that led to Microsoft’s exponential growth in the 1990s and early 2000s. He would take “Think Weeks” where he’d totally disappear for a few weeks, totally unreachable by anyone and without distraction, and just read countless articles and books.^(29) He’d then just think, reflect, ponder, visualize, and ultimately get incredible ideas and breakthroughs. Doubtlessly involved in this process were a select few people he could bounce his ideas back-and-forth with, which was essential to iterating his thinking and ideas. 这就是比尔·盖茨获得了大部分伟大想法的著名途径，这些想法导致了微软在 20 世纪 90 年代和 21 世纪初的指数级增长。他会采取“思考周”，在那里他会完全消失几个星期，完全没有任何人可以接触，没有分心，只是阅读无数的文章和书籍。 ^(29) 然后，他会思考，反思，沉思，想象，并最终获得令人难以置信的想法和突破。毫无疑问，在这个过程中，有少数几个人可以与他反复思考他的想法，这对他反复思考和想法至关重要。

Dan teaches, “Tightly scheduled entrepreneurs cannot transform themselves.” 丹教导说，“日程紧凑的企业家无法自我转型。

There are two modes of experimentation: *Explore* and *Exploit* 有两种实验模式：探索与利用

To go 10x, you’ll want both. 如果你想要 10x，你会想要两者。

*Exploring* happens on Free Days. It’s when you’re detached from the stress and strain of work, and have the freedom and openness of mind to relax, think, and *explore*. I call this recovery-flow or *kairos*-recovery. Exploring is about learning new things via reading books or studying ideas way outside your discipline. But also, in exploring, you can look for new opportunities beyond what you’re currently doing. You’re testing and exploring new things that you’ll eventually commit to and exploit. 探索发生在自由日。它是当你脱离工作的压力和紧张，并拥有自由和开放的心态来放松，思考和探索。我称之为恢复流或 kairos 恢复。探索是通过阅读书籍或研究超出你学科范围的想法来学习新事物。但是，在探索中，你可以寻找你目前正在做的事情之外的新机会。你正在测试和探索新的东西，你最终会致力于和利用。

*Exploiting* happens on Focus Days. This is when you’re in focus-flow or *kairos*-focus and getting stuff done. You’re totally in the focus cave and executing on what you’re fully committed to. 利用发生在焦点日。这是当你处于专注流或 kairos 专注并完成事情的时候。你完全沉浸在专注的洞穴里，并且执行你完全致力于的事情。

By giving yourself more space to recover, think, and innovate—you increase the value of your own time. You transform yourself enormously, while others are on the *chronos-hamster wheel.* 通过给自己更多的空间来恢复、思考和创新，你就增加了自己时间的价值。当其他人处于计时仓鼠轮的时候，你会极大地改变自己。

10x entrepreneurs understand this, and 2x entrepreneurs don’t. 10 倍的企业家明白这一点，2 倍的企业家不明白。

2x entrepreneurs think they need to get all their ducks in a row before they can start taking more time off. They believe they need to have the perfect team in place. 2x 企业家认为，他们需要把所有的鸭子都安排好，然后才能开始更多的休息时间。他们认为他们需要有一个完美的团队。

Even when there were only three employees, Dan and Babs would schedule and take their 180 rejuvenation days each year. During those Free Days, their team was not to contact them in any way. 即使只有三名员工，丹和巴布斯也会安排并采取他们每年的 180 天恢复活力。在那些自由日期间，他们的团队是不能以任何方式联系他们的。

*It’s counterintuitive, but in order to go 10x, you need to work less, not more. 这是违反直觉的，但为了达到 10 倍，你需要更少的工作，而不是更多。*

10x is easier than 2x. 10x 比 2x 更容易。

10x is about innovation and results. It’s a qualitative and non-linear approach to time. 10x 是关于创新和结果的。这是一种定性的和非线性的时间方法。

2x is about busyness and effort. It’s a quantitative and linear approach to time. 2x 是关于忙碌和努力。这是一种定量的线性方法。

## Free Days Part 3: Your Team Can’t Grow and Evolve Unless They Manage Themselves 第三部分：你的团队无法成长和发展，除非他们管理自己

Increased “free time” isn’t just about you. 增加“自由时间”不仅仅是你自己。

By taking more time away from work, you also improve your team, your process, and systems. 通过从工作中抽出更多的时间，你也可以改善你的团队、流程和系统。

Most entrepreneurs learn this lesson way too late: *You never know how good your team is until you go away.* 大多数企业家学到这一课的时间太晚了：你永远不会知道你的团队有多好，直到你离开。

But also, *they’ll never know* how good they can be if you’re constantly managing them. 但同时，如果你一直在管理他们，他们永远不会知道他们可以有多好。

It is by freeing yourself up and being away from the team that your team evolves, takes full ownership, and learns to manage the ship without you. This is what Dan calls a *Self-Managing Company*, and it’s essential to 10x growth. 正是通过释放自己，远离团队，你的团队才得以发展，拥有完全的所有权，并学会在没有你的情况下管理这艘船。这就是 Dan 所说的自我管理公司，这对实现 10 倍增长至关重要。

As Dan explains: 正如 Dan 解释的那样：

“Expanding your freedom of time is essential to having a Self-Managing Company. The more you’re freed up to concentrate totally on what fascinates and motivates you, the more your company can grow.”^(30) “扩大你的时间自由对于拥有一个自我管理的公司至关重要。你越能腾出时间，专注于让你着迷和激励你的事情，你的公司就越能成长。” ^(30)

Your company and vision won’t grow 10x if you’re too busy dealing with daily fires. Going 10x requires having 10x better ideas and innovations, which requires depth of focus-flow and depth of recovery-flow. 如果你忙碌处理日常火灾，你的公司和愿景不会增长 10 倍。要达到 10 倍，需要有 10 倍更好的想法和创新，这就需要聚焦流的深度和恢复流的深度。

You can’t focus if you’re always at work. 如果你总是在工作你就不能集中注意力。

But also, if you’re too afraid to step away from the team, then you’re overly managing them. You’re actually slowing them down. You’re stopping them from self-determination and you’re stopping yourself from evolving. 但是，如果你太害怕离开团队，那么你就是在过度管理他们。你实际上在拖慢他们的后腿。你阻止了他们的自我决定，你阻止了你自己的进化。

You’ve got to step away and give the reins of the ship to someone else. 你得走开把船的缰绳给予别人。

That’s not your role anymore. 那不再是你的角色了。

Attempting to stay in that role keeps not only you 2x, but your entire team and company. 试图留在这个角色不仅让你保持 2 倍，但你的整个团队和公司。

Chapter 6 of this book is entirely focused on showing you how to become a transformational leader and build a self-managing and self-expanding team. 本书的第六章完全集中在向你展示如何成为一个变革型领导者，如何建立一个自我管理和自我扩展的团队。

## Focus Days and Buffer Days: How to Structure Your Day for 10x Transformation and Results 焦点天数和缓冲天数：如何组织你的一天，实现 10x 转变和结果

For years, Dan’s Focus Days and Buffer Days were pretty equal—approximately 90 to 95 days each. However, as Dan has increasingly applied Who Not How^(31) and grown his team, the majority of his workdays—around 150—are now Focus Days. On Focus Days, he’s coaching his entrepreneur clients, creating new tools and models, or collaborating on his podcasts or other projects. His team increasingly handles the preparation. 多年来，丹的专注日和缓冲日都是相当的，大约各 90 到 95 天。然而，随着 Dan 越来越多地应用 Who Not How ^(31) 并扩大他的团队，他的大部分工作日（约 150 天）现在都是专注日。在焦点日，他指导他的企业家客户，创造新的工具和模型，或合作他的播客或其他项目。他的团队越来越多地处理准备工作。

Even still, Buffer Days are super important. Dan still has around 35 Buffer Days per year where he’s meeting with his team, organizing, and planning. These keep everyone on the same page and feeling connected to each other. 即使如此，缓冲日仍然非常重要。Dan 每年仍有大约 35 个缓冲日，在那里他与他的团队会面，组织和计划。这些让每个人都在同一页上，感觉彼此连接。

For each person, Focus Days and Buffer Days will be different. 对于每个人，关注日和缓冲日将不同。

Your Buffer Days are for any form of preparation or organization—whether that be meeting with key collaborators, working with consultants or coaches, meeting with your team, or preparing notes or resources you’ll later use on your Focus Days. 你的缓冲日是为任何形式的准备或组织-无论是与关键合作者会面，与顾问或教练合作，与你的团队会面，还是准备笔记或资源，你将在你的焦点日使用。

Focus Days, conversely, are all about creating results. On Focus Days, entrepreneurs do nothing outside their 20 percent most high impact tasks. Focus Days are for the highest paying activities, which continually go up as you go 10x in your Unique Ability. 相反，焦点日是关于创造结果。在焦点日，创业者除了 20%的影响力最大的任务之外什么都不做。专注日是为最高收入的活动，随着你的独特能力的 10 倍，这些活动会不断增加。

To structure your Focus and Buffer Days for the biggest bang for your buck: 要组织你的专注日和缓冲日，让你的钱获得最大的收益：

**Structure your week for high performance and stack similar activities and meetings next to each other on the same day.** Switching from different types of tasks, such as creative tasks to administrative tasks, is ineffective. 安排你的一周以获得高绩效，并在同一天将类似的活动和会议堆叠在一起。从不同类型的任务，如创造性任务切换到行政任务，是无效的。

Stop running around like a chicken with your head chopped off. 别像只被砍了脑袋的鸡一样到处乱跑。

Rather than trying to do several different activities each day during your week, have days solely focused for specific types of activities. By simply having a meeting later in your day, your mind will continually think about it. You’ll use it as an anchor to everything you’re doing. It will distract and derail your ability to go into the focus cave because you know you’ll have to come out prematurely. 不要在你的一周中每天做几个不同的活动，而是把时间集中在特定类型的活动上。只要在你一天的晚些时候开个会，你的头脑就会不断地思考它。你会把它当作你所做的一切的锚。它会分散你进入焦点洞穴的能力，因为你知道你必须过早地出来。

If you’re going to have meetings in your week, stack them together on one or two days of the week. Leave several work days in your week wide open for your most important work. 如果你要在一周内开会，那就在一周中的一两天开会。在你的一周中留出几个工作日来做你最重要的工作。

This has been massive for me. In the past I’d have meetings scattered everyday throughout my week. Now, I only allow meetings on Fridays except rare and important exceptions. My Mondays through Thursdays are meeting free so I can concentrate on writing, learning, connecting with important people, thinking, and whatever I want. 这对我来说很重要。在过去，我的一周里每天都有会议。我只允许在周五开会，除了罕见和重要的例外。我的周一到周四都是免费的会议，所以我可以集中精力写作，学习，与重要的人联系，思考，以及任何我想做的事情。

Your schedule and role will likely be totally different than mine as a writer. Your Unique Ability and 10x objective are different than mine. Apply the principle to yourself and your situation. Stack similar activities and meetings together on the same days. Don’t scatter meetings throughout your week. Open more of your days for doing your best work and getting *10x better* at your craft. Do this for even a short period of time and others will be shocked by how radical your progress and transformation are. 你的时间表和角色可能会与我作为一个作家完全不同。你的特殊能力和 10 倍目标和我不一样。把这个原则应用到你自己和你的情况上。在同一天将类似的活动和会议叠加在一起。不要把会议分散在你的一周。打开更多的时间来做你最好的工作，并在你的手艺上得到 10 倍的提高。即使是在很短的时间内这样做，其他人也会被你的进步和转变所震惊。

Most people are not giving themselves the space to 10x their flow and craft. They’re living 2x, caught up in the 80 percent, and are living a linear and busy model of time. 大多数人并没有给自己 10 倍的空间，他们的流量和工艺。他们生活在 2 倍的生活中，陷入了 80%的生活中，生活在线性而忙碌的时间模式中。

The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is a brilliant example of tapping into kairos-time and 10xing his skills and results in a *very short time*. He’s a total 10x person and will likely become one of the most elite quarterbacks in the NFL. 费城老鹰队的四分卫贾伦·赫茨是一个很好的例子，他在很短的时间内利用凯罗斯时间和 10 星他的技能和结果。他是一个 10 倍的人，很可能成为 NFL 最精英的四分卫之一。

At the current writing in November of 2022, we are nine weeks into the 2022–2023 NFL season. It’s Jalen’s third year in the league and second as a starter. The Eagles are currently undefeated and Hurts is the leading MVP candidate. 在 2022 年 11 月的当前写作中，我们已经进入了 2022-2023 NFL 赛季的九周。这是贾伦在联盟的第三年，也是第二个首发。老鹰队目前不败，伤害是领先的 MVP 候选人。

In a recent interview, sports commentator Colin Cowherd asked Super Bowl Champion quarterback Trent Dilfer “What am I seeing in Jalen Hurts?” Trent replied, 在最近的一次采访中，体育评论员科林·牛郎问超级碗冠军四分卫特伦特·迪尔弗：“我在贾伦·伤害身上看到了什么？“特伦特：

“I think you’re seeing the product of a lot of lonely work. Jalen Hurts, I remember when he was 17 years old, he was mature like a 25-year-old. He’s an old soul. He’s also an incredibly hard worker and he’s done a lot of the lonely work—the boring, monotonous stuff that no one gets credit for. You don’t post it on Instagram. You don’t post it on Twitter. You don’t pat yourself on the back and say, ‘Look at me working hard.’ You just go to work, and you work on the nuance of your game. You work on the technique. You work on film-study. You lock yourself in because you could be doing a lot of other things. You have a lot of money and a lot of fame. Instead, you decide to do the hard thing, which is lock yourself in a room and study yourself, study your opponent, work on every aspect of your game. I talked to Quincy Avery (the quarterback developer) about Jalen’s off-season regimen. It was intensive. He did say ‘No’ to a lot of the luxuries of life so he could get better. And you’re seeing the payoff of that right now. He’s playing at as high of a level as anybody and he’s not just doing it as a great athlete like everyone thought he would do it. He’s doing it as a true nuanced quarterback in the NFL. My hat’s off to him because I think of all the people in the NFL, you’ve got to look at Jalen Hurts as the guy who’s made the biggest stride from last year to this year and he’s become a bonafide superstar.”^(32) “我想你看到的是很多孤独工作的产物。Jalen Hurts，我记得当他 17 岁的时候，他像 25 岁的人一样成熟。他是个老灵魂。他也是一个难以置信的努力工作者，他做了很多孤独的工作--那些无聊、单调的工作，没有人能得到赞扬。你不会在 Instagram 上发布的。你不会在 Twitter 上发布的。你不会拍拍自己的背说，‘看看我在努力工作。’你只要去工作，在游戏中的细微差别上下功夫。你在练习技巧。你在研究电影。你把自己锁在里面，因为你可以做很多其他的事情。你有很多钱和很多名气。相反，你决定做一件艰难的事情，那就是把自己锁在一个房间里，研究自己，研究你的对手，研究你的比赛的每一个方面。我和昆西·艾弗里（四分卫开发者）谈了贾伦的休赛期养生法。很紧张。他确实对生活中的许多奢侈品说了“不”，这样他就能变得更好了。 你现在就看到了回报。他和任何人一样高的水平踢球，他不仅仅是像每个人都认为他会这样做的那样，作为一个伟大的运动员。他在 NFL 作为一个真正细致入微的四分卫。我向他脱帽致敬，因为我想到 NFL 的所有人，你必须看看 Jalen Hurts 作为一个从去年到今年迈出了最大一步的家伙，他已经成为一个真正的超级巨星。“第 0#个

Jalen Hurts proves that with serious focus and commitment, even at the highest level such as the NFL, you can completely elevate yourself and grow to totally ridiculous levels in a seemingly short span of time. But not if you’re living 2x. Jalen Hurts 证明了，通过认真的专注和承诺，即使是在 NFL 这样的最高级别，你也可以完全提升自己，并在看似短的时间内成长到完全荒谬的水平。但如果你住的是 2x。

You’ve got to have a 10x future and you’ve got to be continually transforming yourself. 你必须有一个 10 倍的未来，你必须不断地改变自己。

You’ve got to spend increasing amounts of time in *kairos*—where you’re evolving at quantum level. *Kairos*-focus and *kairos*-recovery is a way of life. 你必须在凯罗斯花更多的时间在那里你正在量子水平上进化。凯罗斯-专注和凯罗斯-恢复是一种生活方式。

**Create bigger blocks of open space for deep work.** To get 10x better at what you’re doing, adopt what Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham calls a “Maker Schedule.”^(33) Here’s how he explains it: 为深度工作创造更大的开放空间。要想在你正在做的事情上提高 10 倍，就采用 Y Combinator 联合创始人 Paul Graham 所说的“Maker Schedule”。#00001;他是这样解释的：

“There are two types of schedules, which I’ll call the manager’s schedule and the maker’s schedule. The manager’s schedule is for bosses. It’s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one-hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you’re doing every hour. When you use time that way, it’s merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you’re done. But there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers [and performers]. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started. When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Each type of schedule works fine by itself. Problems arise when they meet.” “有两种类型的时间表，我称之为经理的时间表和制造商的时间表。经理的日程表是给老板们看的。它体现在传统的预约簿中，每天都被切成一小时的间隔。如果需要的话，你可以为一项任务留出几个小时，但默认情况下，你每小时都要改变你正在做的事情。当你这样利用时间的时候，与某人见面就只是一个实际问题了。在你的时间表中找一个空的时间，预订他们，你就完成了。但是还有另一种利用时间的方式，这种方式在制作东西的人中很常见，比如程序员、作家（和表演者）。他们通常喜欢使用至少半天的时间单位。你不能以一小时为单位写好或写好程序。这时间还不够开始当你按照制造商的时间表工作时，会议就是一场灾难。一个会议可以把整个下午都毁了，因为它分成了两部分，每一部分都太小了，不能做任何困难的事情。 每种类型的时间表本身都很好。当他们相遇时，问题就出现了。“

Tim Ferris suggests creating blocks of space of at least four hours when you’re working on and trying to solve a massive challenge or creative task.^(34) If you’re going 10x, your time will need to be far less segmented. Far less thinly-sliced. More wide-open days and more blocks of increasing size, like four or more hours without meetings or distractions. 蒂姆·费里斯建议，当你正在努力解决一个巨大的挑战或创造性的任务时，创造至少四个小时的空间。 ^(34) 如果你的时间是 10 倍，你的时间需要少得多。少得多。更开放的日子，更多的街区越来越大，比如四个小时或更多小时没有会议或分心。

Taking Ferris’ advice a step further, the important work happens in kairos-time: not only do you create bigger blocks of time to either explore or exploit—either focus or recover—you actually expand that outward in your weeks and months. You have focus weeks and recovery weeks, focus months and recovery months. You’re taking on bigger projects that require high attention. Yet, you also slip away for weeks or months at a time for *kairos* recovering and exploring—expanding and transforming. 根据费里斯的建议，重要的工作发生在凯罗斯时间：你不仅创造了更大的时间块来探索或利用--专注或恢复--你实际上在你的几周或几个月里扩展了这些时间。你有专注周和恢复周，专注月和恢复月。你正在承担更大的项目，需要高度关注。然而，你也会一次溜走几周或几个月，为 kairos 恢复和探索扩展和转变。

*Kairos*-focus and *kairos*-recovery are how you live decades of experience and growth in a single year. It’s how you slow time while everyone else’s time is accelerating. 凯罗斯专注和凯罗斯恢复是你如何生活几十年的经验和成长在一年。这是你如何让时间变慢而其他人的时间却在加速。

This is how you become the David. This is how you develop extreme Unique Ability. This is how you do and create things that others could never imagine, because others are up closer to the surface—busy, distracted, linear, segmented, *2x*. 你就是这样成为大卫的。这就是你如何发展出极端的独特能力。这就是你做和创造别人永远无法想象的事情的方式，因为别人更接近表面忙碌，分心，线性，分割，2x。

It’s also crucial to note that if you’re going 10x, *you’re not a manager*. . . Managers don’t go 10x. You’re a visionary and Transformational Leader*.* Leaders don’t manage. They build teams of leaders that manage themselves. 同样重要的是要注意，如果你要达到 10 倍，你就不是经理。. .经理人不会去 10 倍。你是一个有远见的变革型领导者，领导者无法管理。他们建立了管理自己的领导团队。

**No more than three personal objectives each day (important and designed for flow).** Former United States president Dwight Eisenhower said, 每天不超过三个个人目标（重要且专为心流设计）。美国前总统德怀特·艾森豪威尔说，

“I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” “我有两种问题：紧急的和重要的。紧急的事情并不重要，重要的事情从来不紧急。”

The 20 percent of activities—your Unique Ability—are important but not urgent. The 80 percent of activities are urgent. At this point, you should probably already be weary of the 80 percent. 20%的活动--你的独特能力--很重要但并不紧迫。80%的活动是紧急的。在这一点上，你可能已经厌倦了 80%。

When it comes to planning your day, you’re going for impact and progress, not busyness. You’re also going for quality over quantity. If you have 10 items of your to-do list, you’re going shallow. You’re not going 10x. 在计划你的一天时，你要追求的是影响力和进步，而不是忙碌。你也会追求质量而不是数量。如果你的待办事项清单上有 10 项，那你就太肤浅了。你不能开 10 倍。

Each day, go for no more than three important results. Once you’re done with those three, call it a day. Celebrate and recover. Make sure those three activities are 10x, not 2x. They are the highest and most enjoyable use of your time. 每一天，不超过三个重要的结果。等你搞定了那三个人，就到此为止吧。庆祝和恢复。确保这三项活动是 10 x，而不是 2x。它们是对你时间的最高和最愉快的利用。

Research shows that there are three essential preconditions of being in a flow state: 研究表明，处于流动状态有三个基本前提：

1.  Clear and specific goals. 明确而具体的目标。
2.  Immediate feedback. 即时反馈。
3.  The challenge and/or risk of the activity is beyond your current skill or knowledge level.^(35) 该活动的挑战和/或风险超出您目前的技能或知识水平。 ^(35)

Make sure your three daily goals are clear and specific, so that you can know where to focus. Make sure your three goals involve some form of feedback, which is, to use Seth Godin’s language, “a collision between your work and the outside world.”^(36) 确保你的三个日常目标是明确和具体的，这样你就知道该关注哪里。确保你的三个目标包含某种形式的反馈，用赛斯·戈丁的话来说，就是“你的工作和外界的碰撞” ^(36)

Feedback has consequences. 反馈有后果。

It takes courage and vulnerability to get direct and quality feedback. You’ve got to be completely honest that “this” is where you’re currently at. There’s risk in getting feedback, but only if you need to *be right*. If you’re more interested in *getting it right*, then you’ll regularly seek feedback as a forcing function to produce and transform your thinking. 获得直接和高质量的反馈需要勇气和脆弱性。你必须完全诚实地说，“这”就是你目前所处的位置。获得反馈是有风险的，但前提是你必须正确。如果你对正确的想法更感兴趣，那么你会定期寻求反馈，作为一种强迫功能来产生和转变你的想法。

Finally, have your three daily activities be beyond your current skill or knowledge level, so that you’re exercising commitment and courage. This is how you grow and transform yourself, developing new capabilities and confidence (think Dan’s 4 Cs). This is how you get one or more percent better every day. No repetition or autopilot. 最后，让你的三项日常活动超出你目前的技能或知识水平，这样你就能锻炼承诺和勇气。这就是你成长和转变自己的方式，培养新的能力和自信（想想丹的 4C）.这就是你每天都能提高百分之一或更多的方法。没有重复或自动驾驶。

**Completely unplug when you’re done and actively recover.** Don’t work longer than is necessary, unless you’re on some extreme deadline like a *kairos*-focus week or month. Achieve your core objectives. Be bold. Then, when it’s time to be done, let it go. 完成后，彻底拔掉插头，积极恢复。不要工作超过必要的时间，除非你在某个极端的截止日期，比如一周或一个月。实现您的核心目标。大胆点然后，当它的时间到了，让它去。

Unplug. 拔掉插头。

*Psychologically detach* from work. 从心理上脱离工作。

Go actively recover and expand the other important areas of your life, because how you do anything is how you do everything. If you’re going 10x in one area, you’ll 10x all other *important* areas of your life as well. Emphasis on the word “important.” 积极地恢复和扩展你生活中其他重要的领域，因为你做任何事情的方式就是你做任何事情的方式。如果你在一个领域达到 10 倍，那么你也将是你生活中所有其他重要领域的 10 倍。强调“重要”这个词

**The simplest evening routine for transformation.** In *The Gap and The Gain*, Dan and I dedicated an entire chapter to mastering the final hour of your day, which also happens to be the highest-impact hour of your day.^(37) 晚上最简单的变身程序。在《差距与收获》一书中，丹和我用了整整一章的篇幅来讲述如何掌握一天中的最后一个小时，这也是你一天中影响力最大的一个小时。 ^(37)

The final hour of your day determines the quality of your sleep as well as the quality of your next day. Over 90 percent of people are 2x at night, where they fall to unhealthy habits and consumption, especially random Internet scrolling.^(38) 一天的最后一个小时决定了你的睡眠质量以及第二天的质量。超过 90%的人在晚上是 2 倍，在那里他们陷入了不健康的习惯和消费，特别是随机上网。 ^(38)

For 10x sleep, put your phone on airplane mode at least 30-60 minutes before bed. Pull out your journal for 3-5 minutes and write down three wins you had that day. These wins will be *any* forms of learning or progress you had, even if they weren’t planned. 要达到 10 倍睡眠，睡前至少 30-60 分钟将手机置于飞行模式。拿出你的日记 3-5 分钟，写下你那天取得的三场胜利。这些胜利将是任何形式的学习或进步，即使他们没有计划。

Then, after you’ve framed the day as a “win”—which is how you want your entire past framed—choose and commit to the three goals or “wins” you’ll get tomorrow. Pray and or meditate and then commit to sleep. Be excited and happy to fully shut it down. 然后，在你把这一天设定为“胜利”之后--这也是你想要你整个过去的方式--选择并承诺你明天将获得的三个目标或“胜利”。祈祷或冥想，然后承诺睡眠。兴奋和高兴地完全关闭它。

## Chapter Takeaways 第四章要点

*   The public education system and traditional corporate structure are based on a quantitative and linear model of time, which is focused on busyness and effort, not flow, creativity, and results. 公共教育体系和传统的企业结构都建立在时间的定量和线性模型之上，它关注的是忙碌和努力，而不是流动、创造力和结果。
*   To go 10x, you approach time qualitatively and non-linearly. 要达到 10 倍，你可以定性地和非线性地接近时间。
*   Entertainers have different segments of time, which are optimized for helping them develop higher levels of mastery in their increasingly valuable performances. 艺人有不同的时间段，这些时间段经过优化，以帮助他们在越来越有价值的表演中发展更高水平的掌握。
*   To go 10x, adopt an entertainer or performance model of time, which is focused on quality, not quantity. It’s also focused on you becoming 10x better in your craft, which involves hyper-focused days, preparation days, and recovery days. 要达到 10 倍，就采用一种时间的艺人或表演模式，这种模式注重质量，而不是数量。它还专注于你在你的工艺上变得 10 倍更好，这包括高度专注的日子，准备的日子和恢复的日子。
*   The more you go 10x, the more recovery and large blocks of open time for novelty, relaxation, fun, and connection are essential. 你去 10 倍的次数越多，就越多的恢复和大块的开放时间来获得新奇、放松、乐趣和联系是必不可少的。
*   Commit to scheduling Free Days throughout your week, month, and year. Choose the number of Free Days that scares you a little bit. You’ll be surprised that you achieve more and better results by doing less. 承诺在你的一周、一月和一年中安排免费日。选择那些让你有点害怕的免费天数。你会惊讶地发现，你做得更少，更好的结果。
*   Working less is essential to making more money and going 10x. 少工作是赚更多钱和 10 倍的关键。
*   Freeing yourself up is a purpose of your team, especially when you evolve to a self-managing company. 解放自己是团队的一个目标，尤其是当你发展成一家自我管理的公司时。
*   You’ll never know how good your team is until you go away. Also, they’ll never know how good they can be until you let them manage themselves. 你永远不会知道你的团队有多好，直到你离开。而且，他们永远不会知道他们可以有多好，直到你让他们管理自己。
*   Structure your week for high performance and flow. Stack and schedule similar activities like meetings on the same day. Only have meetings on various days of the week. Have several days per week where nothing is scheduled. 组织你的一周，以实现高绩效和高流动性。将类似的活动叠加并安排在同一天举行会议。只在一周的不同日子开会。每周有几天没有安排。
*   Adopt a maker schedule, where you have huge time blocks dedicated for deep work and innovation. This is how you’ll get 10x better. Apply focus-flow and recovery-flow at an even higher level, where you not only have focus and Free Days, but you have focus and free weeks, and even focus and free months. 采用一个创客时间表，在那里你有大量的时间块专门用于深度工作和创新。这就是你如何得到 10 倍的好。在更高的层次上应用专注流和恢复流，在那里你不仅有专注和空闲日，而且你有专注和空闲周，甚至有专注和空闲月。
*   Stop working when you’ve completed your three important tasks. Don’t work longer than is necessary. Productive and busy are opposites. Be in the gain, not the gap. 当你完成了你的三项重要任务后，停止工作。不要工作超过必要的时间。高效和忙碌是对立面。在收益中，而不是差距。
*   Optimize your evening routine for increasingly quality sleep. 优化您的夜间作息，提高睡眠质量。
