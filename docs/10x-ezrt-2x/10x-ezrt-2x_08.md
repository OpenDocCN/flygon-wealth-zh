# CHAPTER 6 第六章

# BUILD A SELF-MANAGING COMPANY 打造自我管理型公司

Evolve from Micromanager to Transformational Leader 从微观管理者到变革型领导者

◆ ◆ ◆

*“As soon as I remove myself as a bottleneck, profits increase by 40 percent. What on earth do you do when you no longer have work as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions? Be terrified and hold on to your ass with both hands apparently.” “一旦我解除了自己的瓶颈，利润就增加了 40%。当你不再以工作为借口过度活跃和回避重大问题时，你到底会做什么？“你一定要用双手抓住你的屁股”。*

**— TIM FERRISS^(1) - TIM FERRISS ^(1)**

In early 2017, Susan Kichuk was five months into a yearlong sabbatical when she got an unexpected phone call from a headhunter. 2017 年初，苏珊·基丘克（Susan Kichuk）在为期一年的休假中度过了五个月，当时她接到了一个来自猎头的意外电话。

The headhunter had been struggling to find someone for this particular gig, because it was the most specific job description he’d ever seen. He was telling a friend of his about the impossibility of finding the right person for this particular job, and the friend immediately thought of Susan and made the introduction. 猎头一直在努力寻找适合这份工作的人选，因为这是他见过的最具体的工作描述。他告诉他的一个朋友，他不可能找到适合这份工作的人，这位朋友立刻想到了苏珊，并作了介绍。

The problem was Susan wasn’t looking for a job. 问题是苏珊没有在找工作。

She was, frankly, fried from working non-stop for nearly 30 years—from getting a PhD in business administration in her early 20s, to raising kids, to spending over 25 years helping structure and scale multiple large organizations. 坦率地说，她被连续工作了近 30 年，从 20 岁出头获得工商管理博士学位，到抚养孩子，再到花了 25 年时间帮助构建和扩大多个大型组织。

She’d just spent the previous 17 years as a senior executive for a global organization. Hers was the job of continually developing and improving the organization and ensuring the completion of endless high priority projects. 她刚刚在一家全球性组织担任高级管理人员 17 年。她的工作是不断发展和改进组织，确保完成无休止的高优先级项目。

But as she listened to the headhunter explain the particulars of the job being offered, she was surprised by how interesting and exciting the prospect seemed. It was so interesting that she immediately wanted to get to work and end her sabbatical pre-maturely. 但当她听猎头解释所提供的工作细节时，她惊讶地发现这个前景看起来是多么有趣和令人兴奋。这是如此有趣，她立即想开始工作，提前结束她的休假。

It was a life insurance brokerage called Targeted Strategies Limited that was based on an innovative and brilliant idea. At the time, Targeted Strategies Limited was making millions per year, but it wasn’t sustainable. The CEO and founder, Garnet Morris, had finally reached his wits end. He realized that in order to go 10x, he’d need the right Who—someone other than himself—to run and build the company. 这是一家名为 Targeted Strategies Limited 的人寿保险经纪公司，它基于一个创新和辉煌的想法。当时，目标战略有限公司每年赚数百万美元，但这是不可持续的。首席执行官兼创始人加内特·莫里斯终于到了走投无路的地步。他意识到，为了达到 10 倍，他需要一个合适的人--而不是他自己--来经营和建立公司。

Before getting interviewed, Susan went through a battery of testing and was selected as one of a few candidates for the CEO position. During her interview with Garnet and his board of directors, Susan was bold and direct. She spoke straight to Garnet and said, “I know what you’re trying to do and I can help you do it. I’ve done it many times before. What scares you about hiring me?” 在接受面试之前，苏珊经历了一系列的测试，并被选为首席执行官职位的少数候选人之一。在采访加内特和他的董事会时，苏珊大胆而直接。她直接对 Garnet 说，“我知道你想做什么，我可以帮你做到。我以前做过很多次。你为什么害怕雇我？“

Garnet began listing 4-5 concerns he had about Susan. For starters, she had no experience in the life insurance business. As Susan clearly and boldly dismantled each of his concerns, Garnet eventually turned to his board and said, “I like her the best. Let’s hire her.” Garnet 开始列出他对 Susan 的 4-5 个担忧。首先，她没有人寿保险业务的经验。苏珊清楚而大胆地消除了他的每一个顾虑，Garnet 最终转向他的董事会说：“我最喜欢她了。我们雇她吧。”

Susan’s job was neither simple nor easy. She had the twofold task of: 苏珊的工作既不简单也不容易。她有双重任务：

*   Gaining Garnet’s trust so that he would get out of her way and focus on his Unique Ability: innovating financial solutions for their clients. 获得石榴石的信任，让他避开她，专注于自己的异能：为客户创新金融解决方案。
*   Structuring, optimizing, and scaling a business that had stagnated for years. 构建、优化和扩展停滞多年的业务。

During the first month on the job, Susan carefully assessed the situation top-to-bottom. 在工作的第一个月里，苏珊从上到下仔细地评估了形势。

She dug into the finances. 她调查了财务状况。

How much money are we making? 我们赚了多少钱？

Are we receiving all the money we should be? 我们得到了我们应该得到的所有钱吗？

Where does all the money go? 所有的钱都去哪里了？

She dug into the life insurance policies they sold, trying to figure out where they came from and where they were located. “Not surprisingly,” she told me, “they were not all in one place.” 她仔细研究了他们出售的人寿保险单，试图弄清楚它们来自哪里，位于哪里。“毫不奇怪，”她告诉我，“他们并不都在一个地方。”

She dug into the systems and processes, trying to figure out what had yet to be systemized to free up the people from redundant tasks. 她深入研究系统和流程，试图找出哪些还没有系统化，以使人们从多余的任务中解放出来。

After better understanding the current state of the business and organization, she critically assessed which roles and tasks were actually needed, and who the right people were to fill those tasks. 在更好地了解企业和组织的现状后，她批判性地评估了哪些角色和任务是真正需要的，以及谁是合适的人来完成这些任务。

She found that Garnet was the sole person on the team generating sales for the company. 她发现 Garnet 是团队中唯一为公司创造销售额的人。

She also found that many of the current team were legacy people who either weren’t filling what the company truly needed, or weren’t the best for the job. Many of these legacy team members fit the definition of 2x, meaning they wanted things to mostly remain how they were. They didn’t want the 10x changes Garnet wanted and that ultimately Susan was in the process of creating. 她还发现，目前团队中的许多人都是传统人才，他们要么没有满足公司真正需要的东西，要么不是最适合这份工作的人。许多传统团队成员都符合 2x 的定义，这意味着他们希望事情基本保持原样。他们不想要 Garnet 想要的 10 倍变化，最终 Susan 正在创造的过程中。

Of course, Susan was a rate-buster. She was actually hired by Garnet to be a rate-buster, shattering the 2x-problems keeping the business stuck. She was raising the standard and structuring the business and team to go 10x. 当然，苏珊是个不折不扣的人。她实际上是被 Garnet 聘请来成为一个利率破坏者，粉碎了保持业务停滞的 2x 问题。她正在提高标准，并将业务和团队组织起来，以达到 10 倍的水平。

Some of her initial and simple questions were: 她最初提出的一些简单的问题是：

*What needs to be done? 需要做些什么？*

*Who is doing it now? 现在谁在做这件事？*

*Is this this right Who? 是这样吗谁？*

For the next four years—from 2017 to 2021—Susan went through her 4-step process that ultimately led Targeted Strategies Limited to achieve 10x results. They are are currently posed for another 10x jump over the next 4-5 years. Susan’s four steps are: 在接下来的四年中，从 2017 年到 2021 年，Susan 经历了她的四步过程，最终导致 Targeted Strategies Limited 实现了 10 倍的业绩。他们目前面临着在未来 4-5 年内再跳 10 倍。苏珊的四个步骤是：

1.  Stabilize 稳住
2.  Optimize 优化
3.  Grow 成长
4.  Transform 变换

*Stabilizing* was about making the business functional and compliant. This required Susan to scrutinize the business so she could better understand how it actually makes money. She assessed the policies the company sold, sales, money, the team, and all of the company’s gaping holes. 稳定是为了使业务正常运作和合规。这就要求苏珊仔细检查公司，以便更好地了解它是如何赚钱的。她评估了公司出售的政策、销售额、资金、团队以及公司所有的漏洞。

*Optimizing* was about standardizing key processes and diversifying revenue, so that Garnet was no longer the only person selling. Susan went to the insurance companies and banks that did business with Targeted Strategies and found that all of them *hated* doing business with Targeted. The reason was simple: There were no clear processes or systems in place. 优化是关于标准化关键流程和多样化收入，因此 Garnet 不再是唯一的销售者。苏珊去找了那些与 Target Strategy 做生意的保险公司和银行，发现他们都讨厌和 Target Strategy 做生意。原因很简单：没有明确的程序或制度。

*Growing* was about building relationships and connections with other parties who would sell Targeted Strategies policies, based on Garnet’s innovative structuring and perspectives. Garnet’s brilliance is creating radically innovative solutions to life insurance, removing all the undesired aspects and simplifying life insurance to become a valuable and growing asset you can utilize while you’re alive, not just when you’re dead. He’s constantly coming up with incredible intellectual property (IP), which Susan helps him filter and execute. 成长是关于建立关系和联系的其他方谁将出售目标战略政策，基于 Garnet 的创新结构和观点。Garnet 的辉煌是创造根本创新的解决方案，以人寿保险，消除所有不希望的方面和简化人寿保险成为一个有价值的和不断增长的资产，你可以利用，而不是当你死了。他不断提出令人难以置信的知识产权（IP），苏珊帮助他过滤和执行。

Susan began nurturing relationships with several Principals who were senior members of accounting firms that worked with ultra-high-net-worth individuals, who were the types of people Targeted Strategies also worked with. She recruited many of these Principals to join their team and become the primary sales people, because these Principals understood the business, had the networks, and could speak the language of those they were selling to. 苏珊开始与几位负责人建立关系，这些负责人都是会计师事务所的高级成员，他们与超高净值人士合作，而目标策略也与这些人合作。她招募了许多这样的负责人加入他们的团队，成为主要的销售人员，因为这些负责人了解业务，拥有人脉，并且能说他们销售对象的语言。

Structuring and organizing the business and then getting the best Whos possible was Susan’s objective. As she increasingly got more and better Whos, they continually found more avenues and referrals for selling life insurance policies in the innovative way Garnet had structured them. 苏珊的目标是构建和组织企业，然后尽可能地找到最好的 Whos。随着她越来越多更好的 Whos，他们不断找到更多的渠道和推荐销售人寿保险政策的创新方式 Garnet 已经构建了他们。

After four years, Susan and Garnet grew Targeted Strategies 10x together. 四年后，Susan 和 Garnet 一起将目标战略增长了 10 倍。

Now that they’ve gone 10x, they’ve reached Susan’s fourth stage: *Transformation*. To go 10x again, a few things have changed. First, Garnet has left Targeted Strategies and even the entire Canadian insurance business. He has gone on to start a new company that adds value to clients in other ways. 现在他们已经达到了 10 倍，他们已经到了苏珊的第四阶段：变形。再过 10 倍，有些事情发生了变化。首先，Garnet 已经离开了 Targeted Strategies，甚至整个加拿大保险业务。他继续创办了一家新公司，以其他方式为客户增加价值。

Susan and Garnet still situationally and strategically collaborate together. However, at this point, Susan controls Targeted Strategies and owns it with a few other key people. 苏珊和加内特仍然在战略和战略上合作。然而，在这一点上，苏珊控制着目标战略，并拥有它与其他几个关键人物。

Susan told me that if they’re going to go 10x again, it’s not going to happen working with Principals, as the last 10x did. “To go 10x from here,” Susan told me, “we’re going to need to capitalize on our amazing insurance service platform.” 苏珊告诉我，如果他们要再次去 10 倍，它不会发生与校长工作，因为上一个 10 倍。苏珊告诉我：“要想从这里扩大 10 倍，我们需要利用我们惊人的保险服务平台。”

To get to this point, Garnet created a *Self-Managing Company* led by Susan. For Garnet to be his best, he had to free his mind of everything going on in the day-to-day of the organization. Susan freed him up and then utilized her skills and passion to stabilize, optimize, and grow the company 10x. All the while, Garnet was free to focus on his Unique Ability and passion of learning, growing, and innovating. 为了达到这一点，Garnet 创建了一个由 Susan 领导的自我管理公司。为了让 Garnet 做到最好，他必须把自己的思想从组织的日常事务中解放出来。苏珊解放了他，然后利用她的技能和热情稳定，优化和发展公司 10 倍。在此期间，Garnet 可以自由地专注于他的独特能力和学习，成长和创新的热情。

Every time you go 10x, your freedom of purpose and sense of calling or mission also expand, *exponentially*. 每提高 10 倍，你的目标自由、使命感和使命感也呈指数级增长。

If you’re going to go 10x again and again—meaning you become 10x better and more innovative in your Unique Ability—then it’s essential you create a Self-Managing Company. 如果你打算一次又一次地提高 10 倍--意味着你在独特能力上变得更好、更有创新力--那么你创建一个自我管理的公司是至关重要的。

Having a Self-Managing Company is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a company and team that manages themselves. You’re no longer involved in the day-to-day. You have a team that works for you—without being dependent on you. Again, this doesn’t mean you’re not the visionary and leader. But you’re leading in your proper sphere, where you’re innovating and transforming yourself—and continually exploring and exploiting radically new and exciting opportunities. 拥有一个自我管理的公司正是它听起来像。这是一个管理自己的公司和团队。你不再参与日常生活了。你有一个为你工作的团队，而不是依赖于你。再说一次，这并不意味着你不是一个有远见的人和领导者。但你在自己的领域里处于领先地位，在那里你在创新和改造自己，并不断探索和利用全新的和令人兴奋的机会。

You’re no longer the bottleneck, involved in or managing the team, system, or structure of the business. Instead, you’ve brought on world-class Whos that are better suited for managing the affairs of the system, processes, and team. 您不再是瓶颈，参与或管理团队、系统或业务结构。相反，您带来了更适合管理系统、流程和团队事务的世界级 Who。

You set the vision, your team makes it happen. 你设定了愿景，你的团队让它实现。

As you continually evolve and transform yourself, your thinking, mindset, and identity are always upgrading. You translate your upgrades to your leadership team and they translate that to the rest of the team. 当你不断地进化和改变自己时，你的思维、心态和身份总是在升级。你把你的升级转化给你的领导团队，他们把它转化给团队的其他成员。

In this chapter, you’ll learn the fundamentals of building a Self-Managing Company, and even going beyond that to where you have a self-expanding Unique Ability Team. 在这一章中，你将学习建立一个自我管理公司的基本原理，甚至超越这一点，你将拥有一个自我扩展的独特能力团队。

There is a progression every entrepreneur goes through of being a rugged individual who does everything themselves, to one who *becomes a leader* applying Who Not How in all aspects of their life and business. Eventually, you go from being the leader to replacing yourself with even more capable leaders who run your company for you, freeing you up to go all-in on your Unique Ability and the next exciting evolutions beyond. 每个企业家都经历了一个进步，从一个坚强的人自己做一切，到一个成为一个在生活和业务的各个方面应用谁不是如何的领导者。最终，你从领导者变成了更有能力的领导者，他们替你管理公司，让你可以全力以赴地发挥自己的独特能力，以及接下来令人兴奋的变革。

Specifically, there are four levels you’ll evolve through as an entrepreneur if you continue going 10x to 10x, which this chapter will walk you through. The four levels are as follows: 具体地说，如果你继续从 10 倍到 10 倍，你将经历四个阶段，这一章将带你走过。这四个级别如下：

1.  Level 1 to Level 2 Entrepreneurship: Level one entrepreneurship is being a rugged individual who either does everything themselves or micromanages the few Whos they have. Level two entrepreneurship is where you evolve beyond How-focused rugged individualism to Who-focused leadership, applying Who Not How in all areas of your life and business. 1 级到 2 级创业：第一级创业精神是一个坚强的人，要么自己动手，要么微观管理他们拥有的少数人。第二级创业是指你从以如何为中心的坚固个人主义发展到以谁为中心的领导力，将谁不是如何应用到你生活和业务的所有领域。
2.  Level 2 to Level 3 Entrepreneurship: Going from level two entrepreneurship of being a leader applying Who Not How to level three entrepreneurship means you’ve replaced yourself with better-fit leaders who run your Self-Managing Company. You’re now freed-up from the day-to-day operations to fully focus on exploring new possibilities, innovating the best 20 percent of what you’re now doing, expanding vision, and collaborating within your Unique Ability. 2 级到 3 级创业：从第二级创业-申请“谁不是如何”-进入第三级创业-意味着你已经用更合适的领导人来管理你的自我管理公司。您现在可以从日常操作中解放出来，完全专注于探索新的可能性，创新您现在正在做的 20%的最佳工作，扩大视野，并在您的独特能力范围内进行协作。
3.  Level 3 to Level 4 Entrepreneurship: Going from level three entrepreneurship of having a Self-Managing Company to level four entrepreneurship means everything happening around you, including in your business, operates as Self-Multiplying Unique Ability Teamwork. In a Self-Multiplying Unique Ability Team, all individuals are encouraged to continually and autonomously refine their own roles down to their 20 percent. All right-fit Whos embrace the freedom of being intrinsically motivated and transforming their Unique Ability toward the shared 10x vision that excites them. As each Who more fully embraces their Unique Ability, they continually let go of their 80 percent and replace themselves with a new and better-fit Who to take on that 80 percent. The team continually multiplies itself and everyone is getting exponentially better and more valuable. 3 - 4 级创业：从第三级创业到第四级创业意味着你周围发生的一切，包括在你的企业中，都是自我倍增独特能力团队合作。在一个自我倍增的独特能力团队中，所有的人都被鼓励不断地、自主地完善自己的角色，直到 20%。所有合适的 Who 都拥抱内在激励的自由，并将他们的独特能力转化为共同的 10 倍愿景，这让他们兴奋。当每一个“谁”更充分地拥抱他们的独特能力时，他们会不断地放弃他们的 80%，取而代之的是一个新的、更适合的“谁”来承担这 80%。团队不断地自我倍增，每个人都变得指数级更好，更有价值。

Now, let’s dive into these stages. 现在，让我们进入这些阶段。

## Level 1 to Level 2 Entrepreneurship: From Rugged Individual to Leader Applying Who Not How 1 级到 2 级创业：从坚强的个人到领导者应用谁而不是如何应用

*“You can’t have an innovative, increasingly more profitable company unless you have a Self-Managing Company. With the day-to-day activities of running your business managed by your team, you’re free to look at the big picture vision, continually innovate greater and greater value, and even transform your marketplace.” “除非你有一个自我管理的公司，否则你不可能拥有一个创新的、越来越赚钱的公司。通过由团队管理的日常业务运营活动，您可以自由地看待全局愿景，不断创新，创造越来越大的价值，甚至改变您的市场。”*

**— DAN SULLIVAN^(2) - DAN SULIVAN ^(2)**

In 1997, Tim Schmidt was a young mechanical engineer from West Bend, Wisconsin, who started a small business with three employees. As a business, they lacked clarity. In Tim’s words, “We would do anything people would pay for.” One thing they did was take designs of in-store displays, such as a PlayStation console display in a toy store, and convert the design to make the physical construction possible to complete. 1997 年，蒂姆·施密特是威斯康星州西弯曲市的一名年轻机械工程师，他创办了一家只有三名员工的小企业。作为一家企业，他们缺乏清晰度。用蒂姆的话说，“我们愿意做任何人们愿意付钱的事情。”他们所做的一件事是采取店内显示器的设计，例如玩具店的 PlayStation 控制台显示器，并转换设计，使物理结构可能完成。

By 2007—10 years later—Tim’s company still had three employees and was doing about $300,000 in revenue, not much more than when he started it a decade earlier. 到了 2007 年，也就是 10 年后，蒂姆的公司仍然有三名员工，收入约为 30 万美元，与他 10 年前创办公司时相比并没有多少。

Tim barely experienced 2x growth between 1997-2007, even though he was “working his ass off.” 蒂姆在 1997-2007 年间几乎没有经历 2 倍的增长，尽管他“拼命工作”。

Compare that decade to the last 10 years—2011 to 2022—wherein his current company, U.S. Concealed Carry Association (USCCA), went from $3-4 million in revenue to now over $250 million in revenue, with over 615 employees throughout the United States, and over 700,000 renewing members. Rather than “working his ass off” in 2x-mode, Tim increasingly adds leaders and teams to accelerate the growth of USCCA. 将这十年与过去 10 年（2011 年至 2022 年）进行比较。隐藏携带协会（USCCA）的收入从 300 - 400 万美元增长到现在超过 2.5 亿美元，在美国拥有超过 615 名员工，超过 70 万名续订会员。Tim 没有在 2x 模式下“拼命工作”，而是越来越多地增加领导者和团队，以加速 USCCA 的增长。

Yes, it’s been hard work. 是的，这是很辛苦的工作。

But it’s also been a fun and transformational adventure of increased freedom and success. 但它也是一个有趣的和变革性的冒险增加自由和成功。

What was the difference in those two decades? 这二十年有什么不同？

What was the difference in Tim? 蒂姆有什么不同？

How did he go from starting a new organization to now impacting literally millions of lives annually? 他是如何从创立一个新组织到现在每年影响数百万人的生活的？

Let’s explore Tim’s story. It will help you better understand the progression of going from rugged individual to becoming a *Transformational Leader*. 让我们来探讨蒂姆的故事。它将帮助你更好地理解从坚强的个人成为变革型领导者的过程。

In 1998, Tim held his newborn first child, Timmy Jr., for the first time. In that moment, he thought to himself, “It’s my job to protect and defend this guy, and I don’t know what I’m doing.” 1998 年，蒂姆抱着他刚出生的第一个孩子小蒂米第一次在那一刻，他心想：“保护和捍卫这个家伙是我的工作，我不知道我在做什么。”

Despite having grown up around guns, and his dad having taught him to shoot a gun when he was 12 years old, at that point Tim was 28 years old and didn’t own a firearm. 尽管他在枪支周围长大，他的父亲在他 12 岁时教他开枪，但在这一点上蒂姆 28 岁，没有枪支。

Holding his newborn son spurred Tim to learn about self-defense. In this process, he was a bit shocked by his initial reception to the fire arm industry. 抱着刚出生的儿子，蒂姆开始学习自卫。在这个过程中，他对自己最初对火械行业的接待有些震惊。

Being the engineer and researcher he was, Tim spent a ton of front-end time researching different types of guns until he felt confident about the first handgun he wanted to buy. He drove to the Gun World Gander Mountain store in German-town, Wisconsin, walked into the store, and went to the back where all the glass cases filled with guns were. He walked up to the glass counter and there was a big rough dude standing behind the counter staring at him, who didn’t say a word. 作为一名工程师和研究员，蒂姆花了大量的前端时间研究不同类型的枪支，直到他对他想买的第一把手枪充满信心。他开车去威斯康星州日耳曼镇的枪世界甘德山商店，走进商店，走到后面所有装满枪的玻璃箱。他走到玻璃柜台前，柜台后面站着一个大块头，一句话也没说。

He just stared at Tim. 他只是盯着蒂姆。

“Excuse me, sir, can I look at *that* gun right there?” Tim said, pointing to one of the guns. “对不起，先生，我能看看那把枪吗？“”蒂姆指着其中一把枪说。

Folding his arms, the man looked Tim up and down, then impolitely and cynically asked, “What would a guy like you want with a gun like that?” 那人抱着双臂上下打量着蒂姆，然后不礼貌而愤世嫉俗地问道：“像你这样的人想要这样的枪干什么？“

Startled, Tim replied, “I don’t know, dude! That’s why I’m asking for help.” “我不知道，我不知道。”这就是为什么我请求帮助。”

Needless to say, it wasn’t a positive experience. 不用说，这不是一个积极的经验。

This led Tim down the rabbit hole of gun ownership, education, and protection. He studied these topics intensely on the side for a few years while he was running his engineering business. 这让蒂姆陷入了拥有枪支、教育和保护的兔子洞。他在经营他的工程业务时，曾在一旁深入研究这些课题。

In 2003, Tim started USCCA from his kitchen table. His idea was to publish a print magazine, *The Concealed Carry Magazine*, sharing gun ownership and defense education and stories. 2003 年，Tim 从厨房的桌子上创办了 USCCA。他的想法是出版一本印刷杂志，隐藏携带杂志，分享枪支所有权和国防教育和故事。

It took him six months to create the initial magazine. He took out a $100,000 business line of credit out of his engineering business, without asking the bank, and invested all of it into printing and mailing 30,000 copies of his magazine. He got the addresses from a company that provided list referrals of various demographics. 他花了六个月的时间来创作最初的杂志。他从他的工程业务中提取了 10 万美元的商业信贷额度，没有向银行提出要求，并将其全部投资于印刷和邮寄 3 万份杂志。他从一家公司那里得到了地址，这家公司提供了各种人口统计资料的推荐名单。

Within that first magazine was a call to action to join USCCA for ongoing education, which at that time was essentially a subscription to get a new magazine every six weeks. 在第一本杂志是呼吁采取行动加入 USCCA 进行持续教育，这在当时基本上是订阅每六周获得一本新杂志。

Out of those initial 30,000 copies mailed, 1,000 people subscribed to USCCA for $47 annually. 在最初邮寄的 30，000 份副本中，有 1，000 人订阅了 USCCA，每年 47 美元。

Now Tim had put himself into a sticky situation. He now had 1,000 people who expected him to create a new magazine *every six weeks*, which was a ton of work and required a lot of capital! 现在蒂姆把自己陷入了一个棘手的境地。他现在有 1,000 人期望他每六个星期就能创作一本新杂志，这是一个巨大的工作量，需要大量的资金！

From 2003 to 2007, growth was linear and fairly slow for USCCA. Tim wasn’t yet much of a leader. He didn’t know how to apply Who Not How. He was controlling and mostly did everything himself, because he didn’t trust other people and thought they would screw everything up. Whenever he’d hire someone, they’d become miserable. 从 2003 年到 2007 年，USCCA 的增长是线性的，相当缓慢。蒂姆还不是一个领导者。他不知道如何应用谁不是如何应用。他控制欲很强，几乎所有事情都是自己做的，因为他不相信别人，认为别人会把事情搞砸。每次他雇佣的人，他们都会变得很痛苦。

Despite Tim’s lack of trust and leadership, the U.S. Concealed Carry Association was growing steadily, and by 2007, the company was profitable, doing nearly $1 million in annual revenue with $200,000 in profits. There were four to five employees, half of whom were disgruntled. Yet, USCCA was starting to gain traction. 尽管蒂姆缺乏信任和领导力，但美国政府仍在努力。隐藏携带协会稳步增长，到 2007 年，该公司实现了盈利，年收入近 100 万美元，利润 20 万美元。有四五名员工，其中一半不满。然而，USCCA 开始获得牵引力。

Seeing that the company was showing strong signs of growth, Tim had a few realizations. Firstly, he knew that USCCA was exactly what he wanted to dedicate himself to. Secondly, he realized that in order for the company to grow, “Tim would have to work on Tim” and become a true leader. 看到公司显示出强劲的增长迹象，蒂姆有了一些领悟。第一，他知道 USCCA 正是他想要奉献的。其次，他意识到，为了让公司成长，“蒂姆必须在蒂姆身上下功夫”，成为一个真正的领导者。

He sold his engineering company and went all-in on USCCA. 他卖掉了他的工程公司，全押在 USCCA 上。

They purchased a small office building. 他们买了一座小型办公楼。

Tim began reading lots of business and leadership books and began getting coaching from the *Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)—*a global entrepreneurial training program that also collaborates with Strategic Coach—where he learned how to systemize and operationalize a business and to develop cultural aspects like core values. Tim 开始阅读大量的商业和领导力书籍，并开始接受创业操作系统（EOS）的指导--一个全球创业培训计划，也与战略教练合作--在那里，他学会了如何系统化和操作企业，并发展文化方面，如核心价值观。

From 2007 to 2011, the company went from just under $1 million revenue to $4 million, with 20 employees. The business was still basically built around the magazine, which provided education but also, being a member of an “Association,” provided status and identity. 从 2007 年到 2011 年，该公司的收入从不到 100 万美元增长到 400 万美元，拥有 20 名员工。该业务仍然基本上围绕着杂志建立，它提供教育，但也作为一个“协会”的成员，提供地位和身份。

The year 2011 marked the next crucial inflection point for Tim and USCCA. It was at this point that Tim became committed to building a truly world-class team. He got committed to taking the magazine to the next level, making it more powerful, interesting, and useful. 2011 年是 Tim 和 USCCA 的下一个关键转折点。正是在这一点上，Tim 开始致力于打造一个真正的世界级团队。他致力于将杂志提升到一个新的水平，使其更强大，更有趣，更有用。

Tim also came to a really important insight during a private business coaching session he was having, wherein he considered adding self-defense liability insurance as an integral benefit for being a part of USCCA. Rather than just being an organization focused on defense education and training, they would also provide insurance and protection as part of membership. 蒂姆在一次私人商业辅导会议上也得到了一个非常重要的见解，他认为增加自卫责任保险是 USCCA 的一部分的一个整体好处。而不仅仅是一个专注于国防教育和培训的组织，他们还将提供保险和保护作为成员的一部分。

This was unique, since at the time and even still today for many people, the legalities of self-defense aren’t popular nor embraced. 这是独一无二的，因为在当时，甚至今天对许多人来说，自卫的合法性并不受欢迎，也不被接受。

Thus, Tim began to develop a core philosophy and framework for membership in the USCCA, which is an association for responsible gun-ownership. The three pillars of USCCA are: 因此，蒂姆开始为 USCCA 的成员制定核心理念和框架，这是一个负责枪支所有权的协会。USCCA 的三大支柱是：

With his increasing clarity, direction, and commitment, Tim decided to do something bold. 随着他越来越清晰，方向和承诺，蒂姆决定做一些大胆的事情。

Since 2003 when he initially launched the magazine, the price of annual membership had remained $47\. But with the improved team and customer service; the three-pillared focus of education and training mentally, physically, and legally; and the added benefit of self-defense liability insurance, Tim decided to increase the price nearly 4x for membership in USCCA. It was approximately $200 annually for membership. 自 2003 年他创办该杂志以来，每年会员的价格一直保持在 47 美元。但随着改进的团队和客户服务;三大支柱的教育和培训重点，即心理、身体和法律;以及自卫责任保险的额外好处，蒂姆决定将 USCCA 会员的价格提高近 4 倍。每年约为 200 美元的会员费。

*Immediately half of the members left. 立刻有一半的人离开了。*

USCCA went from 50,000 renewing members to 25,000 in a single day. USCCA 在一天之内从 50，000 名续订会员增加到 25，000 名。

“It felt great,” Tim told me, about cutting his customer base in half and focusing on quality over quantity. “感觉很棒，”蒂姆告诉我，他的客户群减少了一半，专注于质量而不是数量。

Even after cutting their clients in half, the business was now making more than double what it was before and was far more profitable. 即使在将客户削减一半后，该公司的收入仍然是以前的两倍多，利润也远高于以前。

Higher quality, less quantity. 质量更高，数量更少。

Laser focus and clarity of mission and purpose. 激光聚焦和清晰的使命和目的。

Rather than trying to be everything for a large group of people, USCCA narrowed in on a niche, targeted group of people. As Tim explained to me, “Go for the fringes of the bell curve. Going for the middle is death to growing a culture, community, and business.” 而不是试图成为一个大群人的一切，USCCA 缩小了利基，有针对性的人群。正如蒂姆向我解释的那样，“去钟形曲线的边缘。走中间路线是文化、社区和企业发展的死亡。”

Since 2011 when they added the insurance, clarified the mission and focus of USCCA, and focused on quality over quantity members, the company has skyrocketed, going from $3-4 million to over $250 million in annual revenue. 自从 2011 年他们增加了保险，明确了 USCCA 的使命和重点，并专注于质量超过数量成员以来，该公司已经飙升，从 300 万美元到超过 2.5 亿美元的年收入。

Over these past 10-11 years, Tim has focused on developing himself as a leader, as well as developing everyone in his organization. He’s continually getting coaching and educating himself, and he now spends a large portion of his time educating and training his team. 在过去的 10-11 年里，Tim 一直专注于培养自己成为一名领导者，以及培养组织中的每个人。他不断地接受教练和教育，现在他花了很大一部分时间教育和训练他的团队。

It was terrifying for Tim initially taking on that $100,000 line of credit from his engineering business and pouring all of it into the initial shipment of 30,000 magazines. 蒂姆最初从他的工程业务中获得了 10 万美元的信贷额度，并将其全部投入到最初的 3 万本杂志的发货中，这是一件可怕的事情。

It was terrifying raising the price 4x within a short period of time, knowing he’d lose a huge chunk of his customers. 在短时间内将价格提高 4 倍，这是可怕的，知道他会失去一大部分的客户。

Tim has faced his fears again and again—letting go of the 80 percent to go all-in on his 10x vision and purpose. 蒂姆一次又一次地面对他的恐惧--放弃了 80%的钱，全力以赴实现他 10 倍的愿景和目标。

He had to let go of needing to control how everything got done in his business. 他不得不放弃需要控制他的业务中的每件事都是如何完成的。

He invested in tons of coaching, education, and support to improve his thinking to the level where he could build out USCCA into something unique and innovative. He worked with speaking coaches to help him improve his communication and speaking so he could better get the message out there. 他投入了大量的教练，教育和支持，以提高他的思想水平，他可以建立 USCCA 成为独特和创新的东西。他和演讲教练一起工作，帮助他提高沟通和演讲能力，这样他就能更好地传达信息。

He grew himself as a leader and visionary, and continually expands the vision and mindsets of everyone involved with USCCA. To this day, his number one focus is evolving and improving himself such that he can transfer that mindset and growth to his team and the entire population of now 700,000+ USCCA members. 他成长为一个领导者和有远见的人，并不断扩大与 USCCA 参与的每个人的视野和心态。直到今天，他的首要关注点是发展和提高自己，以便他可以将这种心态和成长转移到他的团队和现在 70 万+ USCCA 成员的整个人口。

Tim’s goal is growing the association to over four million members by 2030. 蒂姆的目标是到 2030 年将协会成员增加到超过 400 万。

In a recent talk Tim gave at Joe Polish’s Genius Network group, Tim provided seven principles he’s applied to grow USCCA as he has. These principles reflect much of the science on *Transformational Leadership theory*.^(3) Therefore, I’ll share Tim’s seven principles and also distill connections to the science of Transformational Leadership. 在 Tim 最近在 Joe Polish 的 Genius Network 小组的一次演讲中，Tim 提供了他应用于发展 USCCA 的七条原则。这些原则反映了变革型领导理论的大部分科学内容。 ^(3) 因此，我将分享蒂姆的七条原则，并提炼出与变革型领导科学的联系。

In posing the question, “Why do people join the USCCA?” Tim initially pointed to the three pillars—mental, physical, and legal preparation and training—and all the benefits of being a member. But then he continued: 在提出这个问题时，“为什么人们加入 USCCA？“蒂姆最初指出了三大支柱精神、身体和法律的准备和培训以及成为会员的所有好处。但他接着说：

“Let me be clear, people *do not* join USCCA because of all these benefits. Sure, these benefits are amazing. But they aren’t the real and deeper reason people become members. The truth is, most people don’t directly want all of the benefits we offer. They just want an easy-button that provides those for them. The reason people join any organization or association is *psychographic alignment*. All humans have a deep desire to feel a sense of belonging and connection to a group of people with shared beliefs and culture.” “让我明确地说，人们不会因为所有这些好处而加入 USCCA。当然，这些好处是惊人的。但它们并不是人们成为会员的真实的和更深层次的原因。事实是，大多数人并不直接想要我们提供的所有好处。他们只是想要一个简单的按钮，为他们提供这些。人们加入任何组织或协会的原因是心理上的一致性。所有人类都有一种深深的渴望，希望与一群拥有共同信仰和文化的人产生归属感和联系。

This has been the backbone to everything Tim has developed over the past 20 years at USCCA. Everything they do, from publishing the magazine to having large events, is to create psychographic alignment and a sense of belonging and community among their members. Thus, Tim’s seven principles are centered around building psychographic alignment and belonging. These seven principles are: 这一直是 Tim 在 USCCA 过去 20 年发展的支柱。他们所做的一切，从出版杂志到举办大型活动，都是为了在成员中创造心理上的一致性和归属感和社区感。因此，蒂姆的七个原则是围绕着建立心理一致性和归属感。这七项原则是：

1.  The Story: Your organization, association, or business needs a powerful origin story. “Ideally a true story,” Tim added, laughing. Tim loves the story of the reluctant hero who nervously advances toward what they believe to be a calling or mission. They’re continually stretching themselves to fulfill that mission, facing and overcoming obstacles, and getting their butt kicked along the way. This reflects Joseph Campbell’s *hero’s journey*,^(4) and every good organization or association centers the client *as the* hero of the story. 故事：你的组织、协会或企业需要一个强大的起源故事。“最好是一个真实的故事，”蒂姆笑着补充道。蒂姆喜欢这个不情愿的英雄的故事，他紧张地朝着他们认为是一种召唤或使命前进。他们不断地伸展自己去完成这个使命，面对和克服障碍，并沿着被踢屁股。这反映了约瑟夫·坎贝尔的英雄之旅， ^(4) 和每一个好的组织或协会中心客户作为故事的英雄。
2.  An Ideology: “There needs to be a mission and purpose in your organization that gives people goose bumps,” Tim said. Timeless ideologies are based on *principles*, not politics. The definition of *principle* is “a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.” The definition of *politics* is, “the debate or conflict among individuals or parties having or hoping to achieve power.” Despite being an organization focused on guns and gun safety, nearly 40 percent of USCCA members are Democrat, because the organization isn’t focused on politics, but instead principles, which are relevant to people of all political backgrounds. 意识形态：蒂姆说：“在你的组织中需要有一个让人起鸡皮疙瘩的使命和目标。”永恒的意识形态是基于原则，而不是政治。原则的定义是“一个基本的真理或命题，作为信仰或行为体系或推理链的基础。”政治的定义是“拥有或希望获得权力的个人或政党之间的辩论或冲突”。尽管是一个专注于枪支和枪支安全的组织，但近 40%的 USCCA 成员是民主党人，因为该组织不关注政治，而是关注原则，这与所有政治背景的人都相关。
3.  A Symbol: The organization or association needs a strong-sounding and clear name, as well as a symbol or logo people can associate with the organization, like the Nike swoosh symbol. When Tim first started USCCA when he was the only employee and had zero customers, he called it the *United States Concealed Carry Association* (USCCA). It sounded official and important from the beginning. The symbol should be professionally created, look amazing, and be wearable. A good logo and brand is something that some people are even willing to tattoo on themselves, like Harley-Davidson’s or Apple’s. 一个符号：组织或协会需要一个听起来很强、清晰的名称，以及一个人们可以与组织联系起来的符号或标志，比如耐克的 swoosh 符号。当蒂姆第一次创办 USCCA 时，他是唯一的员工，没有客户，他称之为美国隐藏携带协会（USCCA）。它从一开始就显得很正式和重要。符号应该是专业的创建，看起来惊人的，并可穿戴。一个好的标志和品牌是一些人甚至愿意在自己身上纹身的东西，比如哈雷戴维森或苹果的。
4.  Shared Rituals: A ritual can be any activity that is unique and consistent, which triggers a sense of meaning and belonging. These rituals strengthen the individual’s commitment to the organization and its ideology. At their annual expo, 15-20 thousand USCCA members converge at a specific location, where there are booths, trainings, and other forms of community events. To be admitted into the events, and several times throughout the events, the members are required to show their USCCA membership card. This is one of the rituals they’ve created at USCCA: the pulling out and proudly showing of your membership card. One way to spread and enhance the rituals is to regularly publish content, whether by a blog, YouTube videos, a magazine, etc., highlighting stories of the members engaging in the rituals of the organization and the benefits they get out of that. 共享仪式：仪式可以是任何独特和一致的活动，触发意义和归属感。这些仪式加强了个人对组织及其意识形态的承诺。在他们的年度博览会上，15-20 万 USCCA 成员聚集在一个特定的地点，那里有摊位，培训和其他形式的社区活动。会员必须出示 USCCA 会员卡，才能参加活动，并在活动期间多次出示会员卡。这是他们在 USCCA 创建的仪式之一：抽出并自豪地展示您的会员卡。传播和增强仪式的一种方法是定期发布内容，无论是通过博客、YouTube 视频、杂志等强调成员参与组织仪式的故事以及他们从中得到的好处。
5.  The Enemy: “You have to have an enemy,” Tim said. Interestingly, it’s often easier for people to bond on what they don’t like than what they do. This taps into in-groups and out-groups, where you can clearly point to something and say, “That’s not us.” The enemy, whether a group of people, a set of behaviors, etc., is an inherent aspect of the ideology. At Strategic Coach, one of the “enemies” is the idea of retirement. In this book, the enemy is *2x thinking*, which is where you’ve stopped betting your present (the 80 percent) on a bigger future which excites you (going all-in on your 20 percent Unique Ability). 敌人：“你必须有一个敌人，”蒂姆说。有趣的是，人们往往更容易在他们不喜欢的事情上建立联系，而不是他们所做的事情上建立联系。这可以进入内组和外组，在那里你可以清楚地指向某个东西并说，“那不是我们。”敌人，无论是一群人，一套行为等等是意识形态的固有方面。在 Strategic Coach，“敌人”之一是退休的想法。在这本书中，敌人是 2 倍思维，这就是你不再把你的现在（80%）押在一个更大的未来上，而这个未来会让你兴奋（全押在你 20%的独特能力上）。
6.  The Language: Every sticky organization has a shared *insider language*, with unique words, acronyms, and shared meanings which are continually used in conversation and presented in education materials. When you go to a Strategic Coach meeting, you’ll hear people talking about Who Not How, VOTA, DOSS, Gap and Gain, etc. You can tell someone is an insider and part of the group when they speak the language and understand the intricacies of the shared meanings. 语言：每一个粘性组织都有一个共同的内部语言，有独特的单词，首字母缩写和共享的含义，这些语言在对话中不断使用，并在教学材料中呈现。当你参加战略教练会议时，你会听到人们谈论谁不是如何，VOTA，DOSS，差距和增益等等。你可以看出某人是一个内部人和群体的一部分，当他们说的语言和理解复杂的共享含义。
7.  The Leader: Every organization, association, or movement has a leader. This leader is seen as an attractive character and a servant. They are not the hero of the story; each individual member is the hero. The leader is simply there to serve, guide, and support all the members. The leader takes the customer or member along the journey, helping them through the transformation and process of their own hero’s journey, which the association provides. 领导者：每个组织、协会或运动都有一个领导者。这个领导者被视为一个有吸引力的人物和仆人。他们不是故事的主人公;每个成员都是英雄。领导者只是在那里服务、指导和支持所有成员。领导者带领客户或会员一路走来，帮助他们完成自己英雄旅程的转变和过程，这是协会提供的。

Tim’s story shows someone who went from rugged individual to a *Transformational Leader*. As a transformational leader, he began investing in and developing himself. He expanded his own vision and sense of purpose for himself and the cause he was leading, USCCA. 蒂姆的故事展示了一个人从一个坚强的人变成了一个变革型的领导者。作为一个变革型领导者，他开始投资和发展自己。他扩大了自己的视野和目标感，为自己和他所领导的事业，USCCA。

Rather than stifling his team as he previously had, micromanaging and overcontrolling, he applied *Transformational Leadership* principles of expanding and elevating his team. Some of the core principles of Transformational Leadership, which is the most studied and science-based theory and application of leadership, include: 他没有像以前那样扼杀他的团队，微观管理和过度控制，而是应用变革型领导原则来扩大和提升他的团队。变革型领导力的一些核心原则，这是研究最多和基于科学的领导力理论和应用，包括：

1.  Idealized Influence: Transformational leaders are role models who, through their actions and values, inspire those who follow them. They take risks and commit to chosen values and display convictions that create a sense of confidence in those they lead. 理想化影响力：变革型领导者是榜样，他们通过自己的行动和价值观激励那些追随者。他们敢于冒险，致力于所选择的价值观，并展示出信念，使他们对领导者产生信心。
2.  Inspirational Motivation: Transformational leaders inspire inspiration and a sense of purpose in those they lead. They articulate a vision and communicate expectations and confidence in the team. They communicate with clarity and conviction and shift seemingly negative or challenging circumstances into opportunities for gains and growth. They are gain oriented, not gap minded. 激励动机：变革型领导者能激发灵感，激发他们所领导的人的使命感。他们表达了愿景，传达了对团队的期望和信心。他们以清晰和坚定的信念进行沟通，并将看似消极或具有挑战性的环境转变为获得收益和成长的机会。他们是以收益为导向的，而不是以差距为中心的。
3.  Intellectual Stimulation: Transformational leaders value creativity and autonomy among each team member. The leader involves members in the decision-making process and stimulates creative thinking. They challenge assumptions and create an environment where healthy conflict can arise. They change how their followers think about and frame problems and obstacles, empowering them to take ownership of decisions and results. 智力刺激：变革型领导者重视团队中每个成员的创造力和自主性。领导者让成员参与决策过程，激发创造性思维。他们挑战假设，创造了一个可以产生健康冲突的环境。他们改变了追随者对问题和障碍的思考方式，赋予他们自主决策和结果的能力。
4.  Individualized Consideration: Transformational leaders know that each member of the team is a unique individual, with unique goals and a Unique Ability. Transformational leaders remove friction and anxiety and provide an environment where each unique individual feels free and autonomous to be their best selves and to openly and honestly communicate their challenges, wishes, and perspectives.^(5,6,7,8) 个性化考虑：变革型领导者知道，团队中的每个成员都是独一无二的个体，有着独特的目标和独特的能力。变革型领导者消除了摩擦和焦虑，并提供了一个环境，让每个独特的个体感到自由和自主地成为他们最好的自己，并公开和诚实地沟通他们的挑战，愿望和观点。 ^(5,6,7,8)

In addition to growing into a Transformational Leader, Tim also began enabling the Whos on his team to operate autonomously—leading themselves, taking ownership, and deciding how they would fulfill their individual roles and responsibilities, rather than being helicoptered over by a manager, not a leader. 除了成长为变革型领导者之外，蒂姆还开始让团队中的 Whos 能够自主运作--领导自己，掌握所有权，决定如何履行各自的角色和责任，而不是被经理人（而不是领导人）直升机操纵。

Tim also developed his own philosophy and ideology—and put it into a clear framework—which not only guided the direction and vision of the company and team but also provided psychographic clarity and alignment for the end customer and community. 蒂姆还发展了自己的哲学和意识形态并将其纳入一个清晰的框架，这不仅指导了公司和团队的方向和愿景，还为最终客户和社区提供了心理上的清晰度和一致性。

As a Transformational Leader, Tim provided principles, training, language, rituals, and community for people who want to responsibly own guns. He provided a culture for people to attach and build as a part of their identity. 作为一名变革型领导者，蒂姆为那些想要负责任地拥有枪支的人提供了原则、培训、语言、仪式和社区。他为人们提供了一种文化，让他们依附和建立作为他们身份的一部分。

He also provided a *maturity model*, including an initial level that ascends as the client learns, evolves, and applies USCCA. 他还提供了一个成熟度模型，包括一个随着客户机学习、发展和应用 USCCA 而上升的初始级别。

Tim consciously and humbly went from rugged individualist to Transformational Leader. He stopped needing to control the Hows and instead began investing in himself by getting increasingly high-quality Whos. He let those Whos operate in their Unique Ability and increasingly manage themselves, rather than control their every movement. 蒂姆自觉而谦逊地从粗犷的个人主义者转变为变革型领导者。他不再需要控制 Hows，而是开始通过越来越高质量的 Whos 来投资自己。他让那些 Who 在他们的异能中运行，越来越多地管理自己，而不是控制他们的一举一动。

He became a leader, evolving and expanding himself, his vision, his philosophy, and the unique value he brought to his team and clients. 他成为了一名领导者，不断发展和扩展自己、他的愿景、他的哲学，以及他为团队和客户带来的独特价值。

At each stage of Tim’s development, he had to let go of the 80 percent that got him there, which was now holding him back from making his next 10x jump. 在蒂姆成长的每一个阶段，他都不得不放弃 80%的力量，而现在，这阻碍了他进行下一次 10 倍跳跃。

With Tim’s story now behind us, I will go into some of the core “Who Not How” principles and applications. These are also the core areas people get stuck attempting to apply Who Not How, which stop them from going 10x and keep them stuck in 2x-mode. Tim 的故事已经过去了，我将介绍一些核心的“谁不怎么做”原则和应用。这些也是人们试图应用谁不是如何的核心领域，这阻止了他们去 10 倍，并保持他们停留在 2 倍模式。

 ## WHO NOT HOW FAQ 谁不如何 FAQ

**Question: Who is the first “Who” that young entrepreneurs should get? 问：青年创业者应该得到的第一个“谁”是谁？**

Get an administrative assistant of some sort, whether in-person or digital. Another word for this, using the language of Gino Wickman and the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), is “integrator.” Susan Kichuk is an extremely high-level application of this role, though you can also start small by simply getting a digital assistant who immediately frees-up 20+ hours of your time, the “80 percent” including scheduling, email, logistics, etc. 找一个行政助理，不管是亲自还是数字助理。另一个词，使用 Gino Wickman 和企业家操作系统（EOS）的语言，是“集成商”。Susan Kichuk 是这个角色的一个非常高级的应用程序，尽管你也可以从小规模开始，只需获得一个数字助理，他立即释放你 20 多个小时的时间，“80%”包括日程安排，电子邮件，物流等。

Their job is to *organize you*, make your life easy and simple, and handle mundane and daily tasks. The goal is that your mind is increasingly freed to focus on what you do best, whatever that may be. As the popular saying goes, “Frank Sinatra doesn’t move his own pianos.” 他们的工作是组织你，让你的生活轻松简单，处理平凡的日常任务。目标是让你的头脑越来越自由，专注于你最擅长的事情，不管是什么。正如一句流行的谚语所说，“弗兰克·辛纳屈不会移动他自己的钢琴。

Similarly, Dan advises his entrepreneurs to “Never show up on your own and without a team supporting you.” To be blunt, you simply don’t look high-level if you’re the one answering your own emails and inquiries, and seemingly handling the operations side of your work. You look like a one-person show, which calls into question the level of service and quality, as well as professionalism and results, you can provide. 同样，丹建议他的企业家“永远不要在没有团队支持的情况下独自出现。”坦率地说，如果你是一个回复你自己的邮件和询问，似乎处理你工作的操作方面，你看起来就不像高级。你看起来像一个人的节目，这让人质疑的水平和质量，以及专业和结果，你可以提供。

Never show up without a team. 没有团队就不要出现。

Whenever you’re facing a client or prospect, have that outward facing initial contact and systemized process be handled by a Who, not you. Let your Who organize you and set the stage for you so that you can show up and perform your best work. Not only does this enable you to focus on what you do best, but it also positions you far better for those you serve. 无论何时你面对客户或前景，都要让那些面向外部的初次接触和系统化的过程由一个谁来处理，而不是你。让你的谁组织你，为你设置舞台，这样你就可以出现并完成你最好的工作。这不仅能让你专注于你最擅长的事情，而且还能让你更好地为你所服务的人服务。

In addition to having your Who “set the stage” for the actual work you do, enabling you to just show up, they can and should set the stage for everything else in your life, making it increasingly easier. For example, they can set the stage for your day and week—helping you know where to focus your best energy and efforts and filtering out all the noise so you can keep your mind and attention on the highest-leverage Unique Ability activities. 除了让你的人为你所做的实际工作“设置舞台”，使你能够出现，他们可以也应该为你生活中的其他一切设置舞台，使它变得越来越容易。例如，他们可以为你的一天和一周设置舞台，帮助你知道将最大的精力和努力集中在哪里，过滤掉所有的噪音，这样你就可以把注意力和注意力集中在最高杠杆的独特能力活动上。

**Question: What if I’m scared of being a jerk and bossing someone else around? 问题：如果我害怕成为一个混蛋，对别人发号施令怎么办？**

Clarity in the beginning about what your standards and success criteria are is crucial. However, you can always reconnect and reclarify your standards anytime. If it’s a strong relationship, and if you’re constantly learning and growing, then your standards and processes will always be updating and improving. It should be a continuous and iterative *process*. 一开始就明确你的标准和成功标准是什么是至关重要的。但是，您可以随时重新连接和重新调整您的标准。如果这是一个牢固的关系，如果你不断学习和成长，那么你的标准和流程将一直在更新和改进。这应该是一个持续和反复的过程。

For example, as someone who regularly goes on podcasts to promote my books, I’m regularly communicating to Chelsea, my assistant and implementer, about the standards for the podcasts I go on. It’s never a one-time thing, but an ongoing process of tightening up the filter, which she helps me apply to achieve desired results. 例如，作为一个经常上播客来宣传我的书的人，我经常与我的助手和实施者切尔西沟通，关于我上播客的标准。这从来不是一次性的事情，而是一个不断收紧过滤器的过程，她帮助我实现预期的结果。

The more you apply Who Not How and empower your Whos to take ownership, and the more you experience the freedom of being in your 20 percent, the less you’ll feel like a jerk. 你越多地运用“谁不是怎么样”，越多地赋予你的“谁”以所有权，你就越多地体验到属于你的 20%的自由，你就越不会觉得自己是个混蛋。

You’re a leader. 你是个领袖

They have a job they are excited to support you in. This is *their* job. Get people who *want* to work, and who want to be successful. As Jim Collins stated in *Good to Great*, 他们有一份工作，他们很乐意支持你。这是他们的工作。找到那些想工作、想成功的人。正如 Jim 柯林斯在《Good to Great》一书中所说的那样，

 “If you have the right people on the bus, the problem of how to motivate and manage people largely goes away. The right people don’t need to be tightly managed or fired up; they will be self-motivated by the inner drive to produce the best results and to be a part of creating something great.^(9) ” “如果你在公共汽车上有合适的人，如何激励和管理人的问题就很大程度上消失了。合适的人不需要被严格管理或激励;他们将被内在的驱动力所激励，以产生最好的结果，并成为创造伟大事物的一部分。 ^(9) ” 

**Question: What if you can’t afford a Who? 问：如果你买不起 Who？**

You can’t afford *not* to get Whos. *Don’t see them as a cost.* Getting a Who is an investment in yourself and your results. The longer you wait to get a Who, the more of your time and energy will be sucked up in the 80 percent that only produces 20 percent of your results. Moreover, by being overly spread thin and busy, you’re experiencing very little flow and depth, which is how you produce 10x higher quality results. 你不能不去找谁。不要把它们看作是一种代价。获得一个谁是对你自己和你的结果的投资。你等待的时间越长，你的时间和精力就会被消耗在 80%的结果中，而这 80%的结果只能产生 20%。此外，由于过于分散和忙碌，您体验的流量和深度非常小，这就是您如何产生 10 倍高质量的结果。

When you invest in a Who, not only will you free yourself up by dozens of hours, hours you can spend on the 20 percent of activities that are 10x more valuable, but you’ll flow and focus while you’re doing that 20 percent. All the while, your new Who will be more focused on their role and will more consistently produce the desired results of their role, which you were lackluster and inconsistently producing before. Everything immediately gets better, especially your own psychology and focus, which are foundational to going 10x. 当你投资一个谁，你不仅可以释放自己几十个小时，你可以花在 20%的活动上，这是 10 倍的价值，但你会流动和专注，当你做 20%。与此同时，你的新“谁”将更加专注于他们的角色，并将更一致地产生他们的角色所期望的结果，而你之前没有什么光彩和不一致地产生。一切都会立刻变得更好，尤其是你自己的心理和注意力，这是你达到 10 倍的基础。

**Question: How do you find the right Whos? 问：如何找到合适的 Who？**

*Who Not How* is a continuous process that you’ll progressively get better at with time. It’s like any other skill. In the beginning, you won’t be that great at it. You won’t have the best clarity and filters you’ll use to find highly specific Whos. 谁不是如何是一个持续的过程，你会逐渐变得更好。就像其他技能一样。一开始，你不会那么擅长。你不会有最好的清晰度和过滤器，你将用来找到高度具体的 Who。

You’ll also probably not have the funds to get the most specialized and capable Whos you can. As with all things, start small. But just start. 你也可能没有足够的资金去找最专业和最有能力的人。就像所有的事情一样，从小事做起。但只要开始。

Get your first assistant to take 20 hours of logistical and operational work off your plate. You can find a digital assistant overseas or even a person in the United States for less than $15 per hour to take this role, and you’ll actually be surprised at the level of talent you can find for this role. 让你的第一助理把 20 个小时的后勤和运营工作从你的盘子。你可以在海外找到一个数字助理，甚至在美国找到一个小时不到 15 美元的人来担任这个角色，你实际上会惊讶于你可以找到这个角色的人才水平。

As you start seeing the power of Who Not How, you’ll stop resisting it so much. You’ll feel the power of having someone handle a ton of work for you, and you’ll have more bandwidth to produce more in your 20 percent, which is the unique value you bring to the market place, which also brings you energy, flow, and joy. 当你开始看到谁不是如何的力量时，你就会停止如此抗拒它。你会感受到有人为你处理大量工作的力量，你会有更多的带宽来生产更多的 20%，这是你给市场带来的独特价值，也会给你带来能量，流动和快乐。

There are limitless places you can find a Who—even social media. I found my first two assistants asking my Facebook friends if they knew anyone who wanted a part-time job as my personal assistant. I literally got dozens of applications and both of the women I hired were amazing for that stage of my career. 有无限的地方你可以找到一个谁甚至是社交媒体。我发现我的前两个助理问我的 Facebook 朋友，他们是否认识谁想兼职做我的私人助理。我真的收到了几十份申请，我雇佣的两名女性在我职业生涯的那个阶段都很棒。

Eventually, I stopped finding my own Whos, enabling my assistant to do that for me. I just give her clear directions on the type of results I’m looking for (i.e., my vision and standards) and let her find and interview the Who she feels best about. 最后，我不再找自己的 Whos 了，让我的助手帮我做这个。我只是给予她明确的方向我正在寻找的结果类型（即，我的愿景和标准），让她找到并采访她觉得最好的人。

The more specialized you become, the more specific the Whos you’ll need to help you get your desired results, which actually makes them *easier* to find since there are far fewer of them. As an example, to get this book where I wanted it, I knew I needed an editor that *really* knew business books. It took me less than an hour to think of Helen, who is a top-tier editor of business books like these and has worked on huge titles with household-name-level authors. 你变得越专业，你需要的谁就越具体，以帮助你获得你想要的结果，这实际上使他们更容易找到，因为他们的数量要少得多。举个例子，要把这本书拿到我想要的地方，我知道我需要一个真正了解商业书籍的编辑。我花了不到一个小时的时间就想到了海伦，她是这样的商业书籍的顶级编辑，曾与家喻户晓的作家合作过大量书籍。

**Question: What happens if I get the wrong Who and waste tons of money? 问题：如果我弄错了谁，浪费了大量的钱，会发生什么？**

This happens regularly. Get in the gain, not the gap. Everything happens *for* you, not *to* you. The reason you got the wrong Who is because you weren’t clear on what you wanted, and you weren’t being a great “Buyer,” using Dan Sullivan’s language. When you’re a “Buyer” rather than a “Seller,” you’re very clear on the results you want to create, you have high standards for everything you do, and you only work with increasingly high-impact players who are proven and committed. 这种情况经常发生。在收益中，而不是差距。一切都是为了你而不是为了你。你之所以选错了 Who 是因为你不清楚自己想要什么，你不是一个很好的“买家”，用 Dan Sullivan 的话来说。当你是一个“买家”而不是“卖家”时，你非常清楚你想要创造的结果，你对你所做的每一件事都有很高的标准，你只与那些被证明和承诺的越来越高影响力的玩家合作。

Even still, this is a progression we all go through, and even after you’ve built an amazing team and group of collaborators, there’s never a time you’ll arrive and be completely free of the wrong Whos. The main thing is having a system in place where you filter out the wrong people faster and also course correct faster once you’ve realized the wrong Who is in place. 即便如此，这是我们都经历过的一个过程，即使在你建立了一个了不起的团队和一群合作者之后，你也永远不会有一个时候会完全摆脱错误的 Who。最重要的是要有一个系统，你可以更快地过滤掉错误的人，一旦你意识到错误的人在地方，也可以更快地纠正错误。

Often, you’ll “lose money” on the wrong Whos. Even writing this book, I went through multiple editors and consultants who couldn’t get me and this book where I wanted it to go. But I’m in the gain, not the gap. Therefore, I’m turning my experiences into growth and learning, wherein I’m clearer and clearer, and my system is better in the future for finding Whos than it was in the past. 通常，你会在错误的人身上“赔钱”。即使写这本书，我也经历了许多编辑和顾问，他们无法让我和这本书达到我想要的目的。但我是在获利而不是差距。因此，我把我的经验转化为成长和学习，在那里我越来越清晰，我的系统在未来比过去更好地寻找谁。

Who Not How is not a skill set you’re taught even in business school. Stay in the gain and keep getting better. Over time, the Whos around you will blow you away, and the system will be increasingly self-managing. 即使在商学院里你也不会学到“谁不怎么样”的技能。保持在增益中，继续变得更好。随着时间的推移，你周围的 Who 会让你大吃一惊，系统也会越来越自我管理。

**Question: Is it possible to overdo Who Not How? 问：有没有可能过度做谁不怎么做？**

Not really. The more you place your focus and energy into your 20 percent Unique Ability and get more consistent at producing 10x quality results, the more valuable your time and results will become. Your revenue and income will go 10x again and again, enabling you to get more Whos in all areas of your life. 不太清楚你越是将你的注意力和精力投入到你 20%的独特能力上，并在产生 10 倍质量的结果方面更加一致，你的时间和结果就越有价值。您的收入和收入将一次又一次地增长 10 倍，使您能够在生活的各个领域获得更多的 Who。

10x is about depth and quality. To become a master at what you do, you can’t have a million things on your mental plate sapping your cognitive load. Focus on higher quality and less quantity of things. This also applies in your personal life. If you can get someone to come and clean your house, do various tasks like laundry and dishes, run errands, etc., the higher the quality and depth you’ll have with your family. 10 x 是关于深度和质量。要想成为你所做的事情的大师，你不能有一百万件事情在你的大脑中消耗你的认知负荷。专注于更高质量和更少数量的事情。这也适用于你的个人生活。如果你能找人来打扫你的房子，做各种工作，比如洗衣服、洗碗、跑腿等等你和家人相处的质量和深度就越高。

The personal side can be a big jump mentally for people. But again, this is about leadership and depth. It took years to convince my wife to get a “Mother’s Helper” for 20 hours per week. But Cony has become a crucial member of our family. She watches our little kids—4-year-old twin girls and 2-year-old boy—so Lauren can focus on the older kids who are getting homeschooled. Cony also helps keep our house clean. More so, she also brings a calming and peaceful energy to our home. 个人的一面对人们来说是一个巨大的精神飞跃。但是，这又是关于领导力和深度的问题。我花了好几年时间才说服我妻子找一个每周 20 小时的“母亲助手”。但科尼已经成为我们家的重要成员。她照看着我们的孩子--一对 4 岁的双胞胎女儿和一个 2 岁的男孩--这样劳伦就可以把注意力集中在那些在家上学的大一点的孩子身上。康尼也帮助我们保持房子的清洁。更重要的是，她也给我们的家带来了平静和和平的能量。 

## Level 2 to Level 3 Entrepreneurship: From Leader Applying *Who Not How* to Self-Managing Company 2 级到 3 级创业：从领导者申请谁不申请到自我管理公司

*“Taking your business 10x is only possible by ensuring that you and everyone on your team is operating as quickly as possible within a Self-Managing Company.” “只有确保你和你团队中的每个人都在自我管理公司中尽可能快地运作，才有可能将你的业务提高 10 倍。”*

**— DAN SULLIVAN - 丹·苏利文**

When the 19^(th)-century American religious leader Joseph Smith was building up the city and community of Nauvoo, Illinois—approximately 20,000 people—he was approached by a member of legislature. The government official was keen to understand how Mr. Smith was able to govern such a large group of people, and how he was able to maintain such “perfect order.” The official further remarked that it was impossible for them to govern the people and maintain order in the rest of Illinois. 当 19 世纪美国宗教领袖约瑟夫·史密斯在伊利诺伊州瑙沃市建立城市和社区时，大约有 20，000 人，一位立法机构的成员找到了他。这位政府官员很想了解先生是如何做到的。斯密能够治理如此庞大的一群人，以及他如何能够维持如此“完美的秩序”这位官员进一步表示，他们不可能在伊利诺伊州的其他地方治理人民和维持秩序。

Mr. Smith commented that it was *very easy* to do that. 先生的。史密斯说，这很容易做到。

“How?” responded the gentleman. “To us it is very difficult.” “怎么会？”绅士回答。“对我们来说，这很难。”

Mr. Smith replied, *“I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.”*^(10) 先生的。史密斯回答说：“我教他们正确的原则，他们自己管理自己。” ^(10)

Joseph Smith’s statement about governing a large and zealous religious community is applicable to building a Self-Managing Company. 约瑟夫·史密斯关于管理一个庞大而热心的宗教团体的说法适用于建立一个自我管理公司。

It’s not that hard. 没那么难

It’s actually the easiest way to lead and govern a group. 这实际上是领导和管理一个团体最简单的方法。

You let them *govern themselves*. 你让他们管理自己。

However, in order to do that, there must be a clear vision, standards, and culture. When you have a clear vision and culture—meaning you know who you are and what you’re about—the right Whos will be *attracted to you* and what you’re doing. These “right Whos” won’t need you to motivate and govern them. 然而，要做到这一点，必须有明确的愿景、标准和文化。当你有一个清晰的愿景和文化意味着你知道你是谁和你在做什么时，正确的 Who 会被你和你正在做的事情所吸引。这些“正确的人”不需要你去激励和管理他们。

On the contrary, these right Whos will be intrinsically motivated to bring their best skills (and more) to the table. Actually, a concept connected with Transformational Leadership is what is known as *organizational citizenship behaviors* or *perceived role breadth*.^(11,12,13) Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) are altruistic activities and behaviors that support the team and organization that are “above and beyond” the specifics of their role. This could be doing whatever is required to complete a project, providing support to others, bringing positive energy, etc. It’s actions that are done out of want, not need. Done for the sake of doing, not for any particular reward. 相反，这些正确的 Who 将内在地激励着把他们最好的技能（甚至更多）带到桌子上。事实上，与变革型领导相关的一个概念是所谓的组织公民行为或感知角色广度。 ^(11,12,13) 组织公民行为（OCB）是支持团队和组织的利他性活动和行为，这些活动和行为“高于”他们的角色的具体情况。这可以是做任何需要完成一个项目，为他人提供支持，带来正能量等等。这是出于欲望而做的行为，而不是需要。为了做而做的，而不是为了什么特别的奖励。

Perceived role breadth is what an individual perceives as their role, and research shows that Transformational Leaders build trust and commitment in people, such that they expand their perceived role to include OCBs.^(14,15,16) They see that as part of being on the team, wherein they go above and beyond, not because they have to but because they want to. 感知的角色广度是个人对自己角色的感知，研究表明，转型型领导者在人们中建立信任和承诺，从而扩大他们感知的角色，包括 OCBs。 ^(14,15,16) 他们认为这是团队的一部分，在团队中他们超越，不是因为他们必须这样做，而是因为他们想这样做。

As part of my dissertation research, I found that Transformational Leaders inspire those they lead to expand their role to go far above and beyond by gaining their followers’ trust and commitment.^(17) 作为我的论文研究的一部分，我发现变革型领导者激励那些他们领导的人通过获得追随者的信任和承诺来扩大他们的角色。 ^(17)

*Trust in leader* is a highly researched concept and is a crucial aspect of Transformational Leadership.^(18) Without trust, there is no Transformational Leadership. It’s the mediating force that enables leaders to inspire those they lead to elevate and transform themselves to create results and reach the new standard. 信任领导是一个高度研究的概念，是变革型领导的一个重要方面。 ^(18) 没有信任，就没有变革型领导。它是一种中介力量，使领导者能够激励他们所领导的人提升和改造自己，以创造成果并达到新的标准。

Recent meta-analytic research has shown that trust in leader, as well as *emotional organizational commitment,* facilitates the relationship between Transformational Leadership and expanded role breadth and OCBs.^(19) Basically, Transformational Leaders gain the trust of those they lead, and help those they trust get highly emotionally committed to the cause and vision by which they are all involved. Through that trust in the leader and emotional commitment to the organization and mission, people do amazing things. They do things they never otherwise would have or could have. 最近的元分析研究表明，对领导者的信任，以及情感组织承诺，促进变革型领导和扩大的角色广度和组织公民行为之间的关系。 ^(19) 基本上，变革型领导者赢得了他们领导的人的信任，并帮助他们信任的人在情感上高度致力于他们所参与的事业和愿景。通过对领导者的信任和对组织和使命的情感承诺，人们会做出令人惊叹的事情。他们做了一些他们永远不会做或可能做的事情。

When the “why” is strong enough, you find the “how.” 当“为什么”足够强大时，你就会找到“怎么做”

In this case, when the “why” is strong enough, because the team trusts the leader and is emotionally committed to the cause, there is nothing they can’t do to achieve the objective. 在这种情况下，当“为什么”足够强大时，因为团队信任领导者并且在情感上致力于事业，他们就没有什么做不到的事情来实现目标。

There’s one final layer to this equation, which shows how Transformational Leaders get the most out of people and ultimately enable them to govern themselves as Joseph Smith described to the Illinois government official. 这个等式还有最后一层，它展示了变革型领导者如何从人们身上获得最大的收益，并最终使他们能够管理自己，正如约瑟夫·史密斯对伊利诺伊州政府官员所描述的那样。

In his book *The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that Changes Everything*, Stephen M.R. Covey explains that to gain trust, you don’t earn it. Instead, to gain trust, *you give trust*.^(20) This is what building high quality relationships as well as a Self-Managing Team is all about. Rather than micromanaging and governing people, you give them vision, clarity, culture, and standards to live by. You also respect and value their own evolving and growing standards, which they hold for themselves as individuals. You trust the right Whos to manage themselves. You trust them to expand and clarify their role and to go above and beyond the call of duty. 在他的书《信任的速度》中：The One Thing That Changes Everything，Stephen M.R.柯维解释说，要获得信任，你不能赢得信任。相反，为了获得信任，你要给予信任。 ^(20) 这就是建立高质量的关系以及自我管理团队的意义所在。与其微观管理和管理人们，不如给予他们愿景、清晰度、文化和生活标准。你也尊重和重视他们自己不断发展和成长的标准，这些标准是他们作为个人所持有的。你相信正确的人会管理自己。你相信他们会扩大和澄清他们的角色，并超越职责的召唤。

When you trust people, they show up in amazing ways. 当你信任别人时，他们会以惊人的方式出现。

When you trust the right people, they expand that trust. Not only that, but this is the only way to get the best out of people, and it taps into the essence of human motivation. According to one of the most science-backed motivational theories ever, *self-determination theory,* there are three crucial components of high-levels of intrinsic motivation: 当你信任对的人，他们会扩大这种信任。不仅如此，这也是让人们发挥最大作用的唯一途径，它挖掘了人类动机的本质。根据有史以来最受科学支持的动机理论之一--自我决定理论，高层次的内在动机有三个关键组成部分：

1.  Autonomy: You have freedom to do what you want, how you want, when you want, and with whom you want. 自主性：你有自由去做你想做的事，你想怎么做，你想做的时候，你想和谁在一起。
2.  Mastery: You have the freedom to continually elevate and evolve the artistry and skill of your Unique Ability. 掌握：你有不断提升和发展你独特能力的艺术性和技能的自由。
3.  Relatedness: You have the freedom to create transformational relationships with the 10x individuals you want to collaborate and transform with.^(21,22) 相关性：您可以自由地与 10 个您想要合作和转型的人建立转型关系。 ^(21,22)

In order for people to be highly motivated in what they do, these three pieces are essential. The more autonomy they have in what they do, the more motivated and empowered they will be. As I wrote in *Who Not How*: 为了让人们对他们所做的事情有高度的积极性，这三个部分是必不可少的。他们在做什么时拥有越多的自主权，他们就越有动力和权力。正如我在 Who Not How 中所写的：

 “If you’re going to apply higher levels of teamwork in your life, you’ll need to relinquish control over how things get done. . . Not only must the Who fully own the How, but they must have complete permission to do so.”^(23) “如果你要在生活中应用更高水平的团队合作，你需要放弃对事情如何完成的控制。. .“谁”不仅必须完全拥有“如何”，而且必须获得完全的许可才能这样做。 ^(23) 

Nearly all of the entrepreneurs throughout this book whose stories I’ve highlighted have built a Self-Managing company. 几乎所有在本书中提到的企业家都建立了一家自我管理的公司。

In Chapter 1, I told the stories of Carson Holmquist and Linda McKissack. 在第一章中，我讲述了卡森·霍姆奎斯特和琳达·麦基萨克的故事。

Carson realized that he was the bottleneck of his company, Stream Logistics, and was stalling its ability to go 10x. He was involved in literally every aspect of the decision-making process. He raised up the leadership in Stream Logistics such that he entirely freed up his time and focus to explore everything happening in his business, as well as to better understand his best clients and customers. 卡森意识到，他是他的公司 Stream Logistics 的瓶颈，正在拖延其 10 倍的能力。他几乎参与了决策过程的每一个方面。他提升了 Stream Logistics 的领导地位，使他完全腾出时间和精力去探索他的业务中发生的一切，以及更好地了解他最好的客户和客户。

This led him to realize that his best customers, the High Stakes Freight customers, only made up 5 percent of their clients but over 15 percent of their profits. With his Self-Managing team, Carson was freed up to be in his Unique Ability, expand his vision and leadership, and ultimately redirect the entire ship of the company, which has now 4x’d its profits in the past few years while maintaining the same size of team. 这使他意识到，他最好的客户，高利益货运客户，只占客户的 5%，但超过 15%的利润。随着他的自我管理团队，卡森被释放出来，以他的独特能力，扩大他的视野和领导力，并最终重新定向公司的整个船舶，在过去几年中，该公司现在已经 4 倍的利润，同时保持相同规模的团队。

Linda created various iterations of a Self-Managing Company. First, she hired a personal assistant to manage everything logistical and organizational. Then she hired another assistant and eventually other agents to handle the rest. But even still, at this point she was mostly just applying Who Not How. 琳达创建了一个自我管理公司的各种迭代。首先，她雇了一个私人助理来管理一切后勤和组织工作。然后，她雇了另一名助手，最终又雇了其他代理人来处理剩下的事情。但即便如此，在这一点上，她主要只是应用谁而不是如何。

It wasn’t until she hired her brother-in-law, Brad, to fully manage her businesses that she had a Self-Managing Team. Once she had that in place, she could focus on growing the Keller Williams regions in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. With her Self-Managing Company in place, she did grow two regions, which now have 28 offices and over 5,000 active real estate agents working within them. Her business now does over $14 billion in annual revenue. 直到她聘请了她的姐夫布拉德来全面管理她的业务，她才有了一个自我管理团队。一旦她有了这一点，她就可以专注于在俄亥俄州、印第安纳州和肯塔基州发展凯勒威廉姆斯地区。随着她的自我管理公司的成立，她确实发展了两个地区，现在有 28 个办事处和 5,000 多名活跃的真实的地产经纪人在其中工作。她的公司现在年收入超过 140 亿美元。

None of this would have happened if Linda didn’t go from a rugged individualist to a leader applying Who Not How, to a Transformational Leader of a Self-Managing and Self-Expanding Company. 如果琳达没有从一个坚强的个人主义者变成一个应用谁不是如何的领导者，变成一个自我管理和自我扩张公司的变革型领导者，这一切都不会发生。

In Chapter 2 of this book, I told the story of Chad Willardson, the financial advisor who left his fancy gig at Merrill Lynch to start his own private fiduciary, Pacific Capital. Chad’s progression has followed the same pattern, wherein he went from rugged individualist doing everything himself to eventually applying Who Not How in all aspects of his life and business. 在本书的第二章中，我讲述了查德·威拉德森的故事，他是一位财务顾问，离开了梅里尔证券的花哨工作，创立了自己的私人信托公司太平洋资本。查德的进步遵循了同样的模式，他从一个强硬的个人主义者自己做任何事情，最终应用谁不是如何在他的生活和业务的各个方面。

Eventually, Chad made his company entirely Self-Managing. He is no longer involved in the day-to-day, though he is still leading the overall vision and strategy of Pacific Capital. Now Chad comes into the office maybe 30 days per year to connect with the team, update them on the ongoing vision and focus they have, and support them in any ways they need. 最终，Chad 让他的公司完全自我管理。他不再参与日常事务，但仍领导太平洋资本的整体愿景和战略。现在，Chad 每年可能有 30 天来到办公室，与团队联系，更新他们的愿景和重点，并以任何他们需要的方式支持他们。

Chad is fully freed up to have peak experiences with his family, travel the world, continually upgrade and elevate his thinking, and expand his growing network of collaborators, co-investors, and clients. Chad 完全可以自由地与家人一起享受巅峰体验，周游世界，不断升级和提升他的思维，并扩大他不断增长的合作者、共同投资者和客户网络。

Earlier in the chapter, I told the story of Garnet Morris and Targeted Strategies Group, who is a brilliant innovator and strategist who grew his business into a multimillion-dollar company by applying Who Not How where he could. Yet, it wasn’t until he made his company Self-Managing, by hiring Susan Kichuk, that his company’s growth skyrocketed to totally different levels. Now, Targeted Strategies Group sells more life insurance than any other company in all of Canada, by a factor of 10. 在本章的前面，我讲述了 Garnet Morris 和 Target Strategies Group 的故事，他是一位杰出的创新者和战略家，通过在力所能及的范围内应用“谁不是如何”（Who Not How），将自己的业务发展成为一家价值数百万美元的公司。然而，直到他雇佣了苏珊·基丘克，使他的公司实现了自我管理，他的公司的增长才飙升到完全不同的水平。现在，目标战略集团销售的人寿保险比加拿大任何其他公司都多，增长了 10 倍。

**What about you? 那你呢？**

*   Are you a rugged individualist or are you a leader applying Who Not How? 你是一个坚强的个人主义者还是一个应用谁而不是如何的领导者？
*   Let’s be real: Are you a true leader or are you still a bottleneck manager? 让我们真实的一点：你是一个真正的领导者，还是一个瓶颈管理者？
*   Do you trust your Whos or do you only trust yourself? 你相信你的 Who 还是只相信你自己？
*   Can you imagine what it would be and feel like to have a Self-Managing Company, where you’ve freed yourself up to explore, expand, innovate, learn, and create? 你能想象拥有一个自我管理的公司会是什么样的感觉吗？在那里，你可以解放自己去探索、扩展、创新、学习和创造？
*   Are you ready to become a *transformational leader*? 你准备好成为一名变革型领导者了吗？

## Level 3 to Level 4 Entrepreneurship: From Self-Managing Company to Self-Expanding Unique Ability Teamwork 3 - 4 级创业：从自我管理公司到自我扩展的独特能力团队

*“Having a Unique Ability Team means working out a deal whereby each person is freed up to focus on their own area of Unique Ability. It means hiring people with diverse skills and talents, including in areas where you’re lacking, so that each task and responsibility in your business is covered by someone who loves doing it and is best at it. Your team members will only work this way, though, once they’ve gotten permission to do that from your example. They can’t give themselves any more permission than you demonstrate. Just as it’s true that your team won’t feel they have permission to free themselves up to focus on their areas of Unique Ability without your leadership example, it’s also the case that you won’t be able to focus on your Unique Ability and* *achieve a Self-Managing Company unless your team members are also freed up to focus on what they love to do and do best—those things that give them energy, and therefore, energize the entire organization. To give this kind of freedom to your team requires a profound shift in your thinking, but you’ll increasingly enjoy greater creative and collaborative support for your own Unique Ability as more of your team members are able to focus entirely on theirs. My presence isn’t required for my team to do their best work, and this continual development and expansion of everyone’s Unique Ability Teamwork automatically creates a Self-Managing Company.”* “拥有一个特殊能力团队，意味着达成一个协议，让每个人都有时间专注于自己的特殊能力领域。这意味着雇用具有不同技能和才能的人，包括在你缺乏的领域，这样你的业务中的每一项任务和责任都由热爱并擅长的人承担。但是，当你的团队成员从你的示例中获得许可后，他们才会以这种方式工作。他们不能给予自己更多的许可。正如你的团队不会感到他们有权力解放自己专注于他们的独特能力领域，如果没有你的领导力榜样，你也无法专注于你的独特能力，并实现自我管理的公司，除非你的团队成员也能够解放出来专注于他们喜欢做和做得最好的事情-那些给予他们能量的事情，因此，你将无法专注于你的独特能力，并实现自我管理的公司。激励整个组织。 要给予你的团队这种自由需要你的思维方式发生深刻的转变，但随着更多的团队成员能够完全专注于他们的能力，你将越来越多地享受到对自己独特能力的更大的创造力和协作支持。我的团队不需要我的存在来完成他们的最佳工作，这种持续发展和扩展每个人的独特能力团队合作自动创建了一个自我管理的公司。“

**— DAN SULLIVAN - 丹·苏利文**

Having a *self-multiplying team* is a natural extension of having a self-managing team. 拥有一个自我倍增的团队是拥有一个自我管理团队的自然延伸。

As a leader, you set the tone for everything that happens in your organization and team. When you take seriously your own Unique Ability, and when you’re living the 10x process of going all-in on your 20 percent and continually eliminating the 80 percent, you encourage your team to do the same. 作为领导者，你为组织和团队中发生的一切定下基调。当你认真对待你自己的独特能力时，当你经历了 10 倍的过程，全力以赴地投入 20%，不断地淘汰 80%，你鼓励你的团队也这样做。

You encourage your team to take seriously their own Unique Ability. They are encouraged to double down into their own 20 percent that both excites and scares them, and to continually refine their role as they see fit. Jim Collins explained in *Good to Great* that it’s not just about having the right people on the bus, you want the right people in the right seats.^(24) What Collins didn’t explain is that the “right seat” is ultimately hand-crafted by the right Whos themselves. 你鼓励你的团队认真对待自己的独特能力。他们被鼓励加倍投入自己的 20%，这既让他们兴奋又让他们害怕，并不断完善他们认为合适的角色。吉姆·柯林斯在《从好到伟大》一书中解释说，这不仅仅是在公共汽车上有合适的人，你需要在合适的座位上有合适的人。柯林斯没有解释的是，“正确的座位”最终是由正确的 Whos 自己手工制作的。

In a Self-Managing Company operating with Unique Ability Teamwork, each individual member continually refines their own role so that they’re only working in a few areas that excite and energize them. As they do this, they form new roles with their old 80 percent and bring on right-fit people who excitedly want that 80 percent. This is when a team begins expanding itself in an autonomous way. 在一个以独特能力团队合作运作的自我管理公司中，每个成员不断完善自己的角色，以便他们只在少数几个能激发他们活力的领域工作。当他们这样做的时候，他们用原来的 80%形成了新的角色，并带来了合适的人，他们兴奋地想要这 80%。这是团队开始以自主的方式扩展自己的时候。

Take my company, for example. 以我的公司为例。

When I first started writing books professionally, I did a lot of editing myself. However, over time, as I’ve homed in on 20 percent, I’ve gotten more Whos around me to support and elevate the work I do. This includes strategists, marketing people, publicist, better editors, etc. 当我刚开始专业写书的时候，我自己做了很多编辑。然而，随着时间的推移，当我专注于 20%时，我周围有更多的 Who 来支持和提升我所做的工作。这包括战略家、营销人员、公关人员、优秀编辑等。

All of these Whos have allowed me to increase my commitment to my 20 percent. Now, whenever I collaborate or work with someone, such as Dan Sullivan and Strategic Coach, on these books, they don’t just get me and my Unique Ability. Instead, they get my growing and self-multiplying team that comes with me, which now includes multiple editors, marketers, publishers, administrative assistants, soon-to-be publicists, etc. 所有这些谁让我增加了我的承诺，我的 20%。现在，每当我与某人合作或工作，如丹沙利文和战略教练，在这些书上，他们不仅仅是了解我和我的独特能力。相反，他们得到了我的成长和自我倍增的团队，现在包括多个编辑，营销人员，出版商，行政助理，即将成为公关人员等。

My assistant, Chelsea, recently went through this process herself. When she became my assistant around two years ago, her role involved a great deal of responsibility, including managing my schedule, calendar, etc. Increasingly, I threw more and more at Chelsea, and for a time, she handled it quite well, despite being a mom at home and raising three beautiful kids. 我的助手切尔西最近亲自经历了这个过程。大约两年前，当她成为我的助理时，她的角色涉及到很多责任，包括管理我的日程表、日程表等我越来越多地向切尔西扔了越来越多的东西，有一段时间，她处理得相当好，尽管她是家里的妈妈，养育了三个漂亮的孩子。

However, as my goals grew bigger and the projects I threw at Chelsea to lead and delegate got more intensive, she began dropping important balls. It became obvious that she was spread far too thin. 然而，随着我的目标越来越大，我向切尔西提出的领导和委派的项目越来越密集，她开始丢下重要的球。很明显，她被分散得太薄了。

Her role had grown far too much. She also had become much clearer on the aspects of her job that excited and fascinated her—her own Unique Ability. She clarified the 20 percent of her role she wanted to focus on as well as the 80 percent of her role that she wanted to pass off to a new Who. 她的角色已经成长得太多了。她也清楚了她的工作中让她兴奋和着迷的方面--她自己的特殊能力。她澄清了她想要专注的 20%的角色，以及她想要将 80%的角色传递给一个新的 Who。

Chelsea’s 80 percent revolved around organizational development and the follow-up and completion of big projects. Her superpower 20 percent was in supporting and keeping me organized, as well as supporting the team when they were executing big projects. 切尔西的 80%都是围绕着组织发展和大项目的跟进和完成。她 20%的超能力是支持和保持我的组织，以及在团队执行大项目时支持他们。

Chelsea then went out and found Kaytlin, an unbelievably talented person to take over her old 80 percent. Kaytlin loves organizing systems and processes. She’s also extremely high in her follow-through and completion of big tasks and projects. She loves solving problems and getting things done. Now that Kaytlin is around, Chelsea’s job is 10x more enjoyable and she’s 10x better and more focused on the few areas she loves. 然后切尔西走了出去，找到了凯特林，一个难以置信的天才，接替了她 80%的工作。Kaytlin 喜欢组织系统和流程。她在完成重大任务和项目时也非常出色。她喜欢解决问题，把事情做好。现在 Kaytlin 在身边，Chelsea 的工作是 10 倍的乐趣，她的 10 倍的更好，更专注于她喜欢的几个领域。

Eventually, Chelsea and Kaytlin will identify their own 20 percent, and thus multiply their roles and teams around them autonomously and organically. 最终，切尔西和凯特林将确定自己的 20%，从而自主和有机地增加他们的角色和团队。

A word of caution. One thing that Dan talks about is that when you enable people to autonomously operate in their Unique Ability, they will become increasingly valuable and brilliant at what they do. In fact, they will become so valuable that they will have many options to leave and work for other organizations. 提醒你一句丹谈到的一件事是，当你使人们能够自主地以他们的独特能力运作时，他们将变得越来越有价值，越来越聪明。事实上，他们将变得如此有价值，以至于他们将有许多选择离开并为其他组织工作。

As Dan explains in his book *The Self-Managing Company*: 正如丹在他的书《自我管理公司》中解释的那样：

“The corporate, bureaucratic attitude is that everybody is replaceable, and you never want to become dependent on people. But the only way you can actually make an extraordinary organization, that in fact you’ve grown people’s Unique Ability to such extent that they virtually are irreplicable. If something were to happen that they were to leave, you wouldn’t be able to replace them. You’d have to create something new. We have many people that, if something were to happen to them, there would be a permanent hole in terms of what they were doing. Now, we’d move on to other things and make other people irreplaceable in other ways, but it’s a risk that you take. I don’t think greatness comes without that risk of having people who are so uniquely good at what they do that they’re irreplaceable. It’s the only way you get greatness in an entrepreneurial organization.”^(25) “公司的官僚主义态度是，每个人都是可以替代的，你永远不想依赖人。但你能真正建立一个非凡的组织的唯一方法就是你已经培养了人们的独特能力到了这样的程度，他们几乎是不可复制的。如果发生什么事情，他们要离开，你将无法取代他们。你必须创造一些新的东西。我们有很多人，如果他们发生了什么事，他们所做的事情将永远留下一个洞。现在，我们会转向其他的事情，让其他人在其他方面成为不可替代的，但这是你要冒的风险。我不认为伟大的到来没有这样的风险，即拥有那些在他们所做的事情上如此出色的人，他们是不可替代的。这是你在创业型组织中获得成功的唯一途径。” ^(25)

This is the “risk” you have to take to become great. When you provide an environment of freedom and 10x vision that’s so big that being a part of it transforms people, you risk creating Unique Ability people that are utterly amazing at what they do. 这是你要成为伟大的“风险”。当你提供一个自由和 10 倍愿景的环境，是如此之大，成为其中的一部分改变了人们，你的风险是创造独特能力的人，他们是完全惊人的，他们所做的。

However, there are very few organizations that take Unique Ability seriously. Very few founders and leaders take even their own Unique Ability seriously, let alone becoming Transformational Leaders with a Self-Managing Company, rather than being bottleneck micromanagers. 但是，很少有组织认真对待特殊能力。很少有创始人和领导者会认真对待自己的独特能力，更不用说成为一个自我管理公司的变革型领导者，而不是成为瓶颈微观管理者。

Therefore, it’s a worthwhile risk to take. You create an environment of freedom where the right Whos continually craft their own role and niche. 因此，这是一个值得冒的风险。你创造了一个自由的环境，在这个环境中，正确的人不断地创造他们自己的角色和利基。

A connected risk to developing incredibly brilliant people with insanely valuable Unique Abilities is not having a 10x vision. If you stop having a 10x vision, your best people will leave you. The best people to team up with are not those interested in 2x, only 10x. 培养具有极其宝贵的独特能力的杰出人才的一个相关风险是没有 10 倍的愿景。如果你不再拥有 10 倍的视力，你最好的人就会离开你。最好的团队不是那些对 2x 感兴趣的人，只有 10x。

Is your vision compelling enough that your best people see a 10x future and growth for themselves in it? 你的愿景是否足够吸引人，让你的最优秀的员工看到了 10 倍的未来和自己的成长？

Does being a part of what you’re doing excite, energize, and transform your best people? 成为你正在做的事情的一部分是否会让你的最优秀的员工感到兴奋、充满活力和改变？

Just as true, when you’re operating toward a 10x vision, the 2x people who simply want a “job” will leave. They don’t want to transform at the level your vision requires all involved to be a part of. 同样，当你朝着 10 倍的愿景运作时，2 倍的人只想得到一份“工作”就会离开。他们不想在你的愿景要求所有参与者成为一部分的水平上转变。

If you’re serious about 10x, then freedom is the language and operating system that will get you there. Your own freedom as well as the freedom of everyone else who joins you on your 10x adventure. 如果你对 10x 是认真的，那么自由就是能让你达到目的的语言和操作系统。你自己的自由，以及加入你 10 倍冒险的其他人的自由。

**What about you? 那你呢？**

*   Do you take your Unique Ability seriously enough to free yourself from the 80 percent? 你是否认真对待你的独特能力，让自己从 80%的能力中解脱出来？
*   Do you lead by example and create a culture of freedom where those on your team are given permission to take their Unique Ability seriously as well? 你是否以身作则，创造了一种自由的文化，让你的团队成员也被允许认真对待他们的独特能力？
*   Does your self-managing team have the confidence to go all-in on their Unique Ability, honing their own roles and bringing on additional Whos to handle their former 80 percent? 你的自我管理团队是否有信心全力发挥他们的独特能力，磨练他们自己的角色，并带来额外的 Who 来处理他们以前的 80%？

## Core Applications 核心应用

*   Start getting Whos immediately to handle the 80 percent of tasks you’re currently doing. 立即让 Whos 来处理你目前正在做的 80%的任务。
*   The first Who you’ll likely want is an administrative assistant of some form to take most of the logistical and procedural tasks off your plate, enabling you to focus where you’re best. Get a Who that *organizes and systemizes you*, so you can stop having to continually organize yourself. The more dedicated you are to your creativity and craft, the less bandwidth and cognitive load you’ll be able to give to procedural and organizational tasks. Get Whos to happily and successfully handle that stuff for you. Remember, Frank Sinatra didn’t move his own pianos. Neither should you—whatever that means for you. 第一个你可能想要的人是某种形式的行政助理，可以把大部分的后勤和程序任务从你的盘子里拿走，使你能够专注于你最擅长的地方。找一个能组织和系统化你的人，这样你就不必再不断地组织自己了。你越专注于你的创造力和技巧，你就能给程序性和组织性任务带来的带宽和认知负荷就越小。让 Whos 愉快地成功地为你处理这些事情。记住弗兰克·辛纳屈没有搬自己的钢琴。你也不应该--不管这对你意味着什么。
*   Begin investing in Whos in all the key areas of your life. This will enable greater depth, quality, and flow in all aspects of your life. Every Who you get is an investment in *you*, your life, and your results. 开始在你生活的所有关键领域投资 Who。这将在你生活的各个方面实现更大的深度、质量和流动。你得到的每一个人都是对你、你的生活和你的结果的投资。
*   Before you feel ready, train up leadership to replace you from being the organizational leader of the business. Create a Self-Managing Company that operates and runs without you involved in the day-to-day. The leader(s) you hire or develop will be better than you at leading the organization and team, unless that is 100 percent your Unique Ability. Even still, your best contribution is continually expanding yourself as a person and leader, expanding your vision, and increasing the quality and impact of your Unique Ability for increasingly niche people. 在你感觉准备好之前，先训练领导力，让你从企业的组织领导者位置上取代你。创建一个自我管理的公司，在没有你参与日常工作的情况下运营和运行。你雇用或培养的领导者在领导组织和团队方面会比你更好，除非这是你 100%的独特能力。即便如此，你最大的贡献是不断地扩大自己作为一个人和领导者的地位，扩大你的视野，提高你独特能力的质量和影响力，为日益小众的人群。
*   Create a culture of freedom wherein all team members are encouraged to clarify and expand their own Unique Ability. Each member increasingly specifies what excites them—their own 20 percent—and they are encouraged to pass off their own 80 percent to a new Who, whom they help find and train. 创造一种自由的文化，鼓励所有团队成员澄清和扩展自己的独特能力。每个成员都越来越多地指定什么让他们兴奋--他们自己的 20%--他们被鼓励把自己的 80%交给一个新的谁，他们帮助寻找和训练。

## Chapter Takeaways 第四章要点

*   There are at least four core levels of entrepreneurship that you’ll need to pass through to go 10x again and again. The faster you go up these levels, the faster and easier each following 10x jump will be. 至少有四个核心层面的创业精神，你需要通过这些层面，才能一次又一次地达到 10 倍。你越快去这些水平，更快和更容易每一个 10 倍跳跃将。
*   Level one entrepreneurship is being a solopreneur or micromanager, where you’re a rugged individual who either does all the How yourself, with very little Who. Or, if you do have Whos, you micromanage them, stunting your own freedom and growth, and stunting their autonomy and growth. This is where Tim Schdmit, the founder and CEO of the U.S. Concealed Carry Association (USCCA), was for over a decade until he shifted to level two entrepreneurship. 第一级创业是成为一个个体创业者或微观管理者，你是一个坚强的人，要么自己做所有的如何，很少有谁。或者，如果你有 Who，你会对他们进行微观管理，阻碍你自己的自由和成长，阻碍他们的自主和成长。这就是 Tim Schdmit，美国的创始人兼首席执行官。隐藏携带协会（USCCA），是十多年，直到他转移到二级创业。
*   Level two entrepreneurship is evolving beyond the rugged individual to becoming a leader who applies Who Not How. By applying Who Not How, you begin operating far more in the 20 percent of your 10x process—which is your Unique Ability. You fully trust the Whos to handle the Hows of their various roles, and you don’t micromanage them. You give them autonomy and trust with clear vision and standards. 二级企业家精神正在从坚韧的个人发展成为一个应用谁而不是如何应用的领导者。通过应用“谁不是如何”，你可以在 10 倍流程的 20%中开始更多地操作，这是你的独特能力。你完全信任 Who 来处理他们不同角色的工作，而你不会对他们进行微观管理。你以清晰的愿景和标准给予他们自主权和信任。
*   Level three entrepreneurship goes beyond applying Who Not How in all aspects of your life to creating a Self-Managing Company. In a Self-Managing Company, you’re no longer managing or leading the day-to-day aspects of the business. Instead, you’ve trained up or hired leaders to lead the team and business for you. You’re still a visionary and leader of the business as a whole, and you’re not entirely disconnected. However, increasingly more, the business manages itself without you, freeing you entirely to be in your Unique Ability—where you’re exploring, expanding, innovating, and collaborating. You’re transforming yourself 10x, and, as a result, the vision and freedom in all of your company expands 10x continuously as well. 第三级创业超越了在生活的各个方面应用“谁不是如何”来创建一个自我管理的公司。在一个自我管理的公司中，你不再管理或领导日常业务。相反，你已经培训或聘请了领导者来领导团队和业务。你仍然是一个有远见的人和整个企业的领导者，你并没有完全脱节。然而，越来越多的是，企业在没有您的情况下管理自己，完全解放您的独特能力-在那里您可以探索，扩展，创新和协作。你正在改变自己 10 倍，因此，你公司的愿景和自由度也在不断扩大 10 倍。
*   Level four entrepreneurship is where, in your Self-Managing Company, everyone is increasingly encouraged to operate in their own Unique Abilities—their own 20 percent of the 10x vision. When people are autonomously operating in their Unique Ability, they become incredibly skillful and valuable at what they do. They become self-managing and self-governing leaders themselves, continuing to go above and beyond the call of duty and to focus on *results*, not being busy. They take responsibility for being as valuable to themselves and the team as they can. They feel trusted to go all in on their Unique Ability and become as valuable and powerful as possible. As a result, they multiply themselves by getting others to take over their 80 percent. They do this again and again, and now you have a self-multiplying unique ability team. 第四级创业精神是指在你的自我管理公司里，每个人都越来越被鼓励以自己独特的能力来运作--他们自己的 10 倍愿景的 20%。当人们在他们的独特能力中自主地运作时，他们会变得非常熟练，在他们所做的事情上有价值。他们自己成为自我管理和自我管理的领导者，继续超越职责的要求，专注于结果，而不是忙碌。他们承担责任，尽可能地为自己和团队提供价值。他们感到信任，全力以赴地发挥他们的独特能力，并尽可能地变得有价值和强大。结果，他们通过让别人接管他们的 80%来倍增自己。他们一次又一次地这样做，现在你有一个自我繁殖的独特能力团队。
*   The biggest risk of Unique Ability Teamwork is that the people involved in your 10x vision develop such incredible Unique Abilities that they become attractive to other organizations. However, few places offer them the 10x vision you do, and few offer them the freedom to continue transforming themselves and their Unique Ability as you do. Even still, it’s a true risk that the people you develop will become so good you cannot replace them, and if they leave you won’t find someone like them. That’s the risk of becoming great. 独特能力团队合作的最大风险是，参与你 10 倍愿景的人会发展出令人难以置信的独特能力，以至于他们对其他组织有吸引力。然而，很少有地方能给他们 10 倍的愿景，也很少有地方能给他们像你一样继续改变自己和他们独特的能力的自由。即使如此，你培养的人会变得如此优秀，你无法取代他们，如果他们离开，你将找不到像他们这样的人。这就是成为伟大的风险。
*   The final risk of becoming great is not going 10x. If you’re not going 10x, then the best people will not be attracted to working with you. 2x isn’t exciting or motivating to the best Whos. If you go into 2x mode, you’ll be left with a lot of people working with you who simply want a job. They don’t want 10x transformation and growth. They certainly won’t be expanding their role and going above and beyond. They won’t have the trust in you as their leader or emotional commitment to their organization. They won’t go 10x beyond the call of duty. Instead, they’ll do as little as possible. 成为伟大的最后一个风险不是 10 倍。如果你不去 10 倍，那么最好的人将不会被吸引到与你一起工作。2x 不是令人兴奋或激励最好的谁。如果你进入 2x 模式，你会留下很多人和你一起工作，他们只是想要一份工作。他们不希望 10 倍的转型和增长。他们肯定不会扩大自己的角色，超越和超越。他们不会信任你作为他们的领导者或情感上的承诺他们的组织。他们不会超过任务的 10 倍。相反，他们会尽可能少地做。
