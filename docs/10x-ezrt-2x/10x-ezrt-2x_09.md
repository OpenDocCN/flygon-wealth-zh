10x Is Easier Than 2x 10 倍比 2 倍容易

◆ ◆ ◆

*“In the end we will only be transformed when we can recognize and accept the fact that there is a will within each of us, quite outside the range of conscious control, a will which knows what is right for us, which is repeatedly reporting to us via our bodies, emotions, and dreams, and is incessantly encouraging our healing and wholeness.” “最后，只有当我们能够认识到并接受这样一个事实时，我们才会转变，即我们每个人都有一个意志，完全超出意识控制的范围，一个知道什么对我们来说是正确的意志，它通过我们的身体，情感和梦想反复向我们报告，并不断鼓励我们的愈合和完整性。*

**— DR. JAMES HOLLIS^(1) - James Hollis 博士 ^(1)**

In the book *Power versus Force*, Dr. David Hawkins developed what he calls the *Map of Consciousness*, which conveys where a person is in their spiritual and emotional development. The scale goes from 20 (shame) all the way to 1,000 (enlightenment).^(2) 在《力量与力量》一书中，博士。大卫·霍金斯开发了他所谓的意识地图，它传达了一个人在精神和情感发展中的位置。从 20（羞耻）一直到 1,000（觉悟）。 ^(2)

Everything below 200 (courage) on the scale is operating from a negative emotion, such as guilt (30), apathy (50), fear (100), or anger (150). 所有低于 200（勇气）的东西都是由负面情绪起作用的，例如内疚（30）、冷漠（50）、恐惧（100）或愤怒（150）。

The higher emotional energies include acceptance (350), love (500), joy (540), and peace (600). 更高的情绪能量包括接受（350），爱（500），喜悦（540）和和平（600）。

According to Dr. Hawkins—who spent decades developing and studying this map and testing it on *millions of people*—the average person only advances *five points up* this scale in their entire life. 根据 Dr.霍金斯花了几十年时间开发和研究这张地图，并在数百万人身上进行了测试，平均每个人一生中只在这个比例上前进 5 个百分点。

As he explains in *Power versus Force*: 正如他在《权力与力量》中所解释的那样：

“The average advance in the level of consciousness throughout the global population is little more than five points during a lifetime. Apparently, from untold millions of individual experiences in one’s life, usually, only a few lessons are ever learned. The attainment of wisdom is slow and painful, and few are willing to relinquish familiar, even if inaccurate, views; resistance to change or growth is considerable. It would seem that most people are willing to die rather than alter those belief systems which confine them to lower levels of consciousness.” “全球人口一生中意识水平的平均进步仅略高于 5 个百分点。显然，从一个人一生中无数次的个人经历中，通常只学到了很少的教训。智慧的获得是缓慢而痛苦的，很少有人愿意放弃熟悉的，即使不准确的观点;对变化或生长的抵抗力相当大。似乎大多数人宁愿死，也不愿改变那些将他们限制在较低意识水平的信仰体系。

According to Dr. Hawkins’ research, over 80 percent of the global population operate between 100 (fear) and 150 (anger) in terms of their individual level of consciousness and emotional development. 根据 Dr.根据霍金斯的研究，全球超过 80%的人口在 100（恐惧）和 150（愤怒）之间的个体意识和情绪发展水平。

Given that most people only grow by *five points* on this scale in their entire lifetimes, most people never make it beyond being driven by fear or anger. 考虑到大多数人在他们的一生中只增长了 5 个百分点，大多数人从来没有超越恐惧或愤怒的驱使。

Even still, there are some people *who grow hundreds of points* up this scale, even in a relatively short period of time. It’s available to everyone, though few choose it. 即便如此，还是有一些人在相对较短的时间内增长了数百分。每个人都可以使用它，尽管很少有人选择它。

It takes commitment and courage (200) to begin transforming your life. 开始改变你的生活需要承诺和勇气（200）。

All progress starts by telling the truth. 一切进步都始于说真话。

Once you make commitment and courage toward 10x dreams, you can and will evolve to the higher dimensions on Hawkins’ map. You can reach a place of acceptance, love, peace, and even enlightenment. 一旦你对 10 倍的梦想做出承诺和勇气，你就能够而且将会进化到霍金斯地图上的更高维度。你可以到达一个接受、爱、和平甚至开悟的地方。

You do this by stripping more and more layers of the David away. 你通过剥离越来越多的大卫层来做到这一点。

As you develop your Unique Ability to unfathomable levels, and as you consciously choose a life of freedom, you will have increasing power in your life. You’ll stop operating out of brute-force emotions or energy. 当你将你的独特能力发展到深不可测的水平，当你有意识地选择自由的生活时，你的生活中将拥有越来越多的力量。你将停止在暴力的情绪或能量下运作。

You’ll stop forcing yourself to do anything you don’t want to do. You’ll accept and live by what psychologists call *pull motivation*, rather than push motivation.^(3),^(4) When you’re pulled by what you want and what excites you, that’s freedom and intrinsic motivation. 你不会强迫自己做任何你不想做的事。你会接受心理学家所说的拉动式动机，而不是推动式动机。当你被你想要的东西和让你兴奋的东西所吸引时，那就是自由和内在的动力。

You’ll no longer operate based on need, but want. *You’re free.* 你将不再根据需要运作，而是根据你的需求运作。你自由了

You’ll also stop forcing others to do anything they don’t want to do and create a 10x culture of freedom and transformation for all around you. Increasingly, you *only* operate with people who are fully committed to freedom within their Unique Ability as well. Everyone around you is transforming themselves 10x. 你也将停止强迫别人做任何他们不想做的事情，并为你周围的人创造一个 10 倍的自由和变革的文化。越来越多的时候，你只会和那些在他们独特能力范围内完全致力于自由的人合作。你身边的每个人都在改变自己 10 倍。

Hawkins found that the higher up his map a person goes, the bigger and more profound the ripple effects throughout the world they will have. Here’s how Dr. Hawkins breaks it down: 霍金斯发现，一个人在地图上走得越高，他们在世界范围内产生的涟漪反应就越大、越深刻。这是如何博士。霍金斯打破了它：

*   One person living and vibrating to the energy of optimism and a willingness to be nonjudgmental of others (310) will counterbalance the negativity of 90,000 people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels. 一个人生活和振动的乐观的能量和愿意不评判他人（310）将抵消 90，000 个校准在较低削弱水平的人的消极。
*   One person living and vibrating to the energy of pure love and reverence for all of life (500) will counterbalance the negativity of 750,000 people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels. 一个人生活和振动到纯粹的爱和敬畏所有生命的能量（500）将抵消 750，000 人的负面性，他们校准在较低的削弱水平。
*   One person living and vibrating to the energy of illumination, bliss, and infinite peace (600) will counterbalance the negativity of 10 million people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels. 一个人生活和振动到光明，布利斯和无限和平的能量（600）将抵消 1000 万人的负面性，他们校准在较低的削弱水平。
*   One person living and vibrating to the energy of grace, pure spirit beyond body, in a world of nonduality or complete oneness (700–1,000), will counterbalance the negativity of 70 million people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels.^(5) 一个人生活和振动到优雅的能量，超越肉体的纯粹精神，在一个非二元性或完全合一的世界（700- 1000），将抵消 7000 万人的负面性，他们校准在较低的削弱水平。 ^(5)

Whether Dr. Hawkins’ exact measurements are correct is less important than the central message he’s conveying, as well as the message of this book. 霍金斯博士的精确测量是否正确，不如他所传达的中心信息和本书的信息重要。

By going 10x and stripping away the layers of the David, your life will become increasingly focused and simple. Your Unique Ability will become increasingly rare and valuable. To use author Cal Newport’s language, your “rare and valuable skills” will produce work that’s “so good it can’t be ignored.”^(6) Thus, despite you becoming simpler and more focused, the ripple effects of everything you do will have higher leverage and impact. 通过去 10 倍和剥离大卫的层次，你的生活将变得越来越专注和简单。你的特殊能力将变得越来越稀有和珍贵。用作家 Cal 纽波特的话来说，你的“稀有而有价值的技能”将产生“如此好以至于不能被忽视”的作品。 ^(6) 因此，尽管你变得更简单、更专注，但你所做的每一件事所产生的涟漪反应将具有更高的杠杆作用和影响力。

There’s a Chinese saying, “Si liang bo qian jin,” which roughly translates to “Defeat a thousand pounds with four ounces.” 中国有句谚语，“四不十斤”，大致翻译过来就是“四两胜千斤”。

As you go deeper into your Unique Ability, you apply less and less pressure yet produce 10x, 100x, 1,000x and more the impact and leverage. 当你深入到你的独特能力，你施加的压力越来越小，但产生 10 倍，100 倍，1,000 倍甚至更多的影响力和杠杆。

You can defeat a thousand pounds with four ounces of leverage. 你可以用四盎司的杠杆打败一千磅。

There’s a fictional story of an operational problem at a nuclear power plant. The malfunction was slowing energy generation down and reducing the efficiency of the entire plant. It became an extreme bottleneck.^(7) 有一个虚构的故事是关于一个核电站的运行问题。故障减慢了发电速度，降低了整个工厂的效率。成为了一个极端的瓶颈。 ^(7)

The plant’s engineers spent months and months trying to solve the problem but couldn’t figure it out. Consequently, they brought in one of the nation’s top consultants on nuclear powerplant engineering. For the next several hours, he looked around at every little detail of the plant—studying the hundreds of dials and gauges and taking notes and making calculations. 工厂的工程师们花了好几个月的时间试图解决这个问题，但始终无法解决。因此，他们请来了一位全国顶尖的核电厂工程顾问。在接下来的几个小时里，他仔细观察了工厂的每一个细节--研究了数百个刻度盘和仪表，做了笔记和计算。

After nearly a full day’s work, he pulled a marker out of his pocket, climbed up a ladder, and put a big “X” on the one of the gauges. “This is the problem,” he said, pointing to the big X. “Replace this and everything will be back to functioning properly.” 工作了将近一整天后，他从口袋里掏出一个记号笔，爬上梯子，在其中一个仪表上画了一个大大的“X”。“这就是问题所在，”他指着大 X 说。“换掉这个，一切都会恢复正常。”

This specialist then left the plant and flew home. 这位专家随后离开工厂飞回家。

Later that day, the plant manager got an email from the consultant’s assistant with an invoice of $50,000. 当天晚些时候，工厂经理收到了顾问助理发来的一封电子邮件，上面有一张 5 万美元的发票。

Despite the fact that this single problem was costing the plant hundreds of thousands of dollars every week, the manager was still shocked by the fee. He replied to the assistant, “How is it possible for less than a day’s work to be valued at $50,000? All he did was write an X with a marker.” 尽管这一个问题每周都要花费工厂数十万美元，经理还是被这笔费用吓了一跳。他回答助手：“不到一天的工作怎么可能价值五万美元？他所做的只是用记号笔写了一个 X。”

The assistant replied, “$1 for the X, and $49,999 for knowing where to put the X.” 助理回答说：“X 是 1 美元，知道把 X 放在哪里的 49,999 美元。”

In the words of author and speaker Brian Tracy, “Knowing where to put that X is your focal point.” 用作家兼演讲者布莱恩·特雷西的话来说，“知道把 X 放在哪里是你的焦点。”

Your “focal point” is the concentrated energy of your Unique Ability. 你的“焦点”是你独特能力的集中能量。

The more you evolve your Unique Ability by going 10x again and again, the more powerful and impactful the focal point of all you do will be, because you’ll be increasingly operating by power and not force. 你越是一次又一次地将你的独特能力提升到 10 倍，你所做的一切的焦点就越强大和有影响力，因为你将越来越多地依靠力量而不是武力来运作。

You’ll have extreme leverage and flow. 你将拥有极大的杠杆和流动性。

All the while, you’ll continuously be expanding your four freedoms: 在此期间，你将不断扩展你的四个自由：

1.  Freedom of Time 时间自由
2.  Freedom of Money 金钱自由
3.  Freedom of Relationship 关系自由
4.  Freedom of Purpose 目的自由

Each of these four freedoms is *qualitative* and individual. They are based far more on quality and value than on quantity and comparison. 这四种自由都是质的和个人的。它们更多地基于质量和价值，而不是数量和比较。

As you go 10x, the quality and value of your time will expand, as will the quality and value of your money and how you get paid, as well as the quality and value of those you spend time and work with, and finally the quality and value of your overall purpose and mission in life. 随着你的增长 10 倍，你时间的质量和价值将扩大，你的钱的质量和价值，你如何获得报酬，以及你花时间和工作的人的质量和价值，最后是你生活中的整体目标和使命的质量和价值。

As I’m wrapping up this book and our time together, it’s crazy looking at my life now, in November of 2022, and attempting to compare it to where I was at the beginning of this year. My life is profoundly and qualitatively different *and better* in so many ways. 当我结束这本书和我们在一起的时光时，看着我现在的生活，在 2022 年 11 月，并试图将它与我今年年初的情况进行比较，这真是太疯狂了。我的生活是深刻的和质的不同，在很多方面都更好。

Certainly, I could compare the differences, and it’s good to be *in the gain* and measure those differences explicitly. 当然，我可以比较这些差异，而且最好能在收益中明确地衡量这些差异。

Yet, at the same time, who I am now and what my life is like versus even 10–12 months ago is incomparably and non-linearly different. There was no obvious and linear path from where I was to where I’m at now. The whole system and context of my life, relationships, attention, and focus is entirely evolved from where I was before. 然而，与此同时，我现在是谁，我的生活是什么样的，甚至与 10-12 个月前是不可比拟的和非线性的不同。从我所在的地方到现在的地方，没有明显的线性路径。我生活的整个系统和背景、人际关系、注意力和注意力都完全从我以前的地方演变而来。

The world is entirely different. 世界完全不同了。

My trajectory is non-linear, yet better. 我的轨迹是非线性的，但更好。

I’m freer to live in and cultivate my Unique Ability. 我更自由的生活和培养我的特殊能力。

My team is self-managing, and we’re continually improving and systemizing our minimum standards of excellence. 我的团队是自我管理的，我们不断改进和系统化我们的最低标准。

Recently, I had the opportunity to take these concepts into a unique and personally meaningful environment. I’d been asked by the mission leader of my church in Ft. Lauder-dale to come and train the leadership of his mission on these concepts. 最近，我有机会将这些概念带入一个独特的和有个人意义的环境。我曾被我在 FT 教会的使命领袖问。劳德代尔来训练他的领导者，对这些概念的使命。

The mission leader had a spreadsheet of the mission’s numbers over the previous 12 months. As a mission of around 200 missionaries, they’d baptized 430ish people in the past 12 months. Part of the report broke down the different “finding” activities into three core categories: 1) working with members of the church, 2) finding people to teach in their own way such as knocking on doors, and 3) using social media. 使命团长有一份过去 12 个月特派团人数的电子表格。作为一个由大约 200 名传教士组成的使命，他们在过去的 12 个月里为 430 人施洗。报告的一部分将不同的“寻找”活动分为三个核心类别：1）与教会成员合作，2）找人以自己的方式教导，例如敲门，3）使用社交媒体。

Forty percent of the baptisms came from working with the members of the church and getting referrals from those members of people to teach. 40%的洗礼来自与教会成员的工作，并从这些成员那里获得教导。

Thirty-four percent of the baptisms came from the missionaries’ own finding efforts. One of these activities accounted for a huge portion of these finding efforts—13 percent overall—which was getting referrals from those they were teaching. 34%的洗礼来自传教士自己的努力。其中一项活动占了这些寻找工作的很大一部分--总共占 13%--这就是从他们所教的人那里获得推荐。

Finally, 26 percent of the overall baptisms came from finding and teaching people via social media. 最后，26%的洗礼来自于通过社交媒体寻找和教导人们。

During the training, and while going over these numbers, I asked the missionaries how much time they worked during a regular day. 在训练期间，在查看这些数字的同时，我问传教士们在正常的一天中工作了多少时间。

“Eight hours,” they responded. “八个小时，“他们回答。

“How many of those eight hours are spent working with members?” I asked. “这八个小时中，有多少是和成员一起工作的？“我问。

“Maybe one,” they replied. “也许一个，“他们回答。

“What about working on social media?” I asked. “在社交媒体上工作呢？“我问。

“Maybe 15-30 minutes,” they replied. “大概 15-30 分钟吧，”他回答。

“So let me get this straight. You spend 1.5 hours of your day engaged in activities that account for 66 percent of your baptisms?” “所以让我把这个弄直。你每天花 1.5 小时从事的活动占你洗礼的 66%？“

One-and-a-half out of eight hours is 18.75 percent, less than 20 percent. 八个小时中的一个半小时是 18.75%，不到 20%。

If you include the simple activity of the missionaries asking the people they’re teaching for referrals, which takes just a few minutes and accounts for 13 percent more of their baptisms, then we’re talking about almost exactly *20 percent* of their time yielding *80 percent* of results. 如果你把传教士向他们所教的人请求转介的简单活动也算进去，这只需要几分钟时间，就占了他们洗礼的 13%，那么我们说的是他们几乎 20%的时间产生了 80%的成果。

According to constraint theory, every unit or system has a core goal or objective. That core objective also highlights the core constraint or bottleneck that must be solved in order for the goal to be achieved. 根据约束理论，每个单元或系统都有一个核心目标或目标。这一核心目标还突出了为实现这一目标而必须解决的核心制约因素或瓶颈。

Without solving the bottleneck, you won’t achieve the goal, no matter how much energy and effort you’re putting in. 不解决瓶颈，无论你投入多少精力和努力，你都无法实现目标。

The bottleneck is the 20 percent. 瓶颈是 20%。

Everything else is the 80 percent, which doesn’t meet the filter of the goal. 其他的都是 80%，这不符合目标的过滤器。

In most businesses, the majority of energy and resources are put toward activities in the 80 percent, not the bottleneck, which is why most business are growing linearly not exponentially. Most businesses are 2x at best, not 10x. 在大多数企业中，大部分的精力和资源都投入到 80%的活动中，而不是瓶颈，这就是为什么大多数企业都是线性增长而不是指数增长的原因。大多数企业最多是 2 倍，而不是 10 倍。

To go 10x, you let go of the 80 percent and put your energy, attention, and resources into the bottleneck, which is the 20 percent. 要达到 10 倍，你就要放弃 80%，把精力、注意力和资源投入瓶颈，也就是 20%。

The missionaries keep dedicated records of every person they contact and teach in a digital “Area Book.” When they contact a person and teach them a simple lesson, the person gets a colored dot on the digital map of their Area Book—such as grey. As that person advances with the missionaries, such as wanting more lessons or coming to church, the color of their dot changes. 传教士在数字“地区手册”中保留了他们接触和教导的每一个人的专用记录。当他们联系一个人并教他们一个简单的教训时，这个人得到一个彩色的点在他们的地区册的数字地图上-例如灰色。当那个人与传教士一起前进时，比如想要更多的课程或来教堂，他们的圆点的颜色就会改变。

I explained to the missionaries the concept of *fitness function* and that as a person or group, you *are* what you’re optimizing *for*. 我向传教士们解释了适应度函数的概念，以及作为一个人或团体，你就是你正在优化的对象。

“If you want to double your baptisms as a mission, you’ll have to get half the dots you’re now getting. Are you okay with that?” “如果你想把你的洗礼作为一个使命加倍，你必须得到你现在得到的一半的点。你没意见吧“

This was mind-blowing to them. 这对他们来说是一种震撼。

They were beginning to see that individually and collectively, they’d been *optimizing for dots*—contacting and teaching people—when *baptizing individuals and families* was their stated and true goal. 他们开始看到，个人和集体，他们一直在优化点接触和教导人当洗礼个人和家庭是他们明确和真正的目标。

10x is about higher quality and less quantity. 10 x 是关于更高的质量和更少的数量。

Most of their “dots” were people who were never going to get baptized, found through low-quality activities that had a low conversion rate (one percent or less) such as knocking on doors. 他们的大多数“点”是那些永远不会受洗的人，他们是通过低质量的活动发现的，这些活动转化率很低（1%或更低），比如敲门。

Not all dots are created equal. 并非所有的点都是平等的。

Not all activities are created equal. 并非所有的活动都是平等的。

You could get thousands of “dots” or contacts but get only a handful of actual baptisms. 你可以得到成千上万的“点”或接触，但得到的实际洗礼只有少数。

If they wanted to baptize more, they’d need their “dots”—the people they’re teaching—to come from the highest-yielding 20 percent of activities: working with members, getting referrals from the people they’re already teaching, and social media. 如果他们想要更多的洗礼，他们需要他们的“点”--他们所教导的人--来自最高收益的 20%的活动：与会员合作，从他们已经教过的人那里获得推荐，以及社交媒体。

“If you want quick wins, you can keep your 80 percent and keep collecting dots,” I told them. “If you want to go bigger and elevate your standards and baseline, then you’ll need to let go of the 80 percent and stop optimizing for dots.” “如果你想快速获胜，你可以保留你的 80%，继续收集点，”我告诉他们。“如果你想扩大规模，提高你的标准和基线，那么你需要放弃 80%，停止优化点。

One sister missionary asked, “But we’ve been taught to keep ‘all of our lines’ out in the water. This feels like we’re pulling many of our lines out of the water.” 一位传教士姊妹问道：“但是我们被教导要把'所有的线'都放在水里。这感觉就像是我们把许多线从水里拉出来。“

I replied, “What if your lines are in the wrong ponds, and there are no fish where you’re fishing?” 我回答说：“如果你的钓线放错了池塘，你钓的地方没有鱼怎么办？“

Another sister missionary raised her hand and said, “This reminds me of the story of Peter and his brothers fishing all night and catching nothing. Then Jesus came and told them to put their nets on the other side of the boat and immediately there were so many fish the boat almost sank.” 另一位传教士姊妹举手说：“这使我想起彼得和他的兄弟们整夜钓鱼，却一无所获的故事。耶稣来了，吩咐他们把网放在船的另一边，立刻鱼太多，船几乎沉下去。

When you insist on doing what you’ve been doing, 10x is essentially impossible. 当你坚持做你一直在做的事情时，10 倍基本上是不可能的。

Only when you expand your vision and focus on the 20 percent can immediate and transformative results be yours. 只有当你扩大你的视野，专注于 20%的人，你才能立即获得变革性的结果。

The mission leader felt inspired that God wanted them to double their minimum standard from 50 baptisms as a mission per month, which they’d recently been getting, to 100 baptisms per month. The missionaries now understood that it would be unlikely for them to realize that new standard if they kept their 80 percent. 使命的负责人感到鼓舞，因为上帝希望他们将最低标准从每月 50 次洗礼增加到每月 100 次，这是他们最近得到的。传教士们现在明白，如果他们保持 80%的比例，他们就不太可能实现这个新标准。

However, if they focused on the 20 percent—and got 10x better and more skilled in the 20 percent—then they’d realize and systemize the new standard in a short period of time. Actually, they’d blow way past the new standard. 然而，如果他们专注于这 20%，并在这 20%中提高 10 倍，熟练程度更高，那么他们将在短时间内认识到并系统化新标准。实际上，他们已经超过了新标准。

Indeed, if they got serious about the 20 percent, and getting 10x better in the few things that matter, as well as letting go of the 80 percent that is keeping them stuck—then they’d be able to go 10x. 事实上，如果他们认真对待这 20%，在少数重要的事情上提高 10 倍，同时放弃让他们停滞不前的 80%，那么他们就能提高 10 倍。

**What about you? 那你呢？**

*   What is your 10x vision? 你的 10x 视力是什么？
*   What is your 20 percent? 你的 20%是多少？
*   What is your Unique Ability? 你的独特能力是什么？
*   Are you committed to going 10x and creating a Self-Managing Company? 你是否致力于 10 倍，并创建一个自我管理的公司？
*   Are you playing the infinite game or stuck in a finite one? 你是在玩无限游戏还是陷入有限游戏？
*   Are you ready for 10x freedom and purpose? 你准备好了 10 倍的自由和目标吗？
*   Are you going to let go of your 80 percent again and again, devoting your time to an ever-shrinking 20 percent within 20 percent within 20 percent, becoming the most powerful, unique, and optimized version of yourself? 你会一次又一次地放下你的 80%，把你的时间花在 20%以内的 20%以内的 20%上，成为最强大、最独特、最优化的自己吗？

10x is easier than 2x. 10x 比 2x 更容易。

2x is doing the same thing, only more of it. It’s brute force, not intelligent, not transformational, not an upgrade in thinking. 2X 做的是同样的事情，只是更多。这是蛮力，不是智慧，不是变革，不是思维的升级。

10x is an entirely different way of doing things, based on an entirely different future. To go 10x, you can’t avoid the bottleneck—the 20 percent. Instead, you fully embrace and transform it, knowing all the while that the bottleneck has always been *yourself*. 10 x 是一种完全不同的做事方式，基于一个完全不同的未来。要达到 10 倍，你无法避免瓶颈--20%。相反，你完全拥抱并转变它，一直知道瓶颈一直是你自己。
