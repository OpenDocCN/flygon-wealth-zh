# Ben’s 本的
Acknowledgments 致谢

Wow, this book has been a complete doozy to write. It’s been a thrill ride that has changed my life in so many ways. As I look at the holistic system of my life—inside and out—now, versus when I started writing this book in late 2021, it’s shocking. My inside and outside feel and look non-linearly and qualitatively different from when I started this book. 哇，这本书写得太棒了。这是一次惊险的旅程，在很多方面改变了我的生活。当我审视我现在生活的整体系统时，与我在 2021 年底开始写这本书时相比，这是令人震惊的。我的内在和外在的感觉和外观与我开始写这本书时的感觉和外观是非线性和质的不同。

My wife and I have reframed what matters to us, and how we want to live. We’ve dramatically improved our own connection, as well as the climate and culture of our family, and how we relate to our six kids. We live far more based on want, not perceived need. 我和我的妻子重新定义了什么对我们来说重要，以及我们想要如何生活。我们极大地改善了我们自己的联系，以及我们家庭的气候和文化，以及我们与六个孩子的关系。我们的生活更多的是基于欲望，而不是感知的需要。

I have a different office, one that resonates much more deeply with my vision and desired lifestyle. I drive a different car. I’ve shed many of my former biases, weaknesses, distractions, and people who were keeping me at 2x, not 10x. My schedule is completely different, and how I approach my time. Rather than being busy, my time is much slower and simpler—with bigger blocks for creativity and focus, and full days and even weeks dedicated to either flow-based focus or flow-based recovery. My identity and standards are totally evolved, and are much clearer and more committed than they’ve ever been. The structure and focus of my business are different, much simpler and focused on the 10x I’m committed to, and thus I’ve shed several degrees of 80 percent I was holding on to just 3 to 12 months ago, including some of the most lucrative aspects of my business the past five years. 我有一个不同的办公室，一个与我的愿景和理想的生活方式产生更深共鸣的办公室。我开的是另一辆车。我已经摆脱了许多以前的偏见，弱点，分心，以及那些让我保持 2 倍而不是 10 倍的人。我的时间表是完全不同的，我如何处理我的时间。与其说我很忙碌，倒不如说我的时间过得更慢更简单创造力和专注力的时间块更大了，整天甚至几周都专注于基于心流的专注或基于心流的恢复。我的身份和标准完全进化了，比以往任何时候都更加清晰和坚定。我的业务的结构和重点是不同的，更简单，专注于我致力于的 10 倍，因此我已经摆脱了我在 3 到 12 个月前坚持的 80%的几个学位，包括过去五年我业务中最赚钱的一些方面。

I say all of this to say, I’m totally humbled and transformed personally by the ideas and stories presented in this book. It changed my life to write it, and it also changed how I write. I did everything I could in writing this book to provide the best possible path for every reader to get 10x qualitative and quantitative transformations in their lives, even and especially those who have already gone 10x many times before. 我说这一切是为了说，我完全谦卑，并通过这本书中提出的想法和故事转变个人。写这本书改变了我的生活，也改变了我写作的方式。在写这本书的过程中，我竭尽所能地为每一位读者提供了一条最好的途径，让他们在生活中获得 10 倍的定性和定量转变，甚至是那些已经经历过 10 倍多次的读者。

There are many people who were essential and integral for me being able to understand the concepts of this book, and to put it on paper in a way I believe the concepts, stories, and ideas deserve. 有很多人对我来说是必不可少的，他们能够理解这本书的概念，并以我认为这些概念，故事和想法应得的方式把它写在纸上。

Firstly, I thank Dan and Babs for trusting me with Dan’s concepts and ideas, as well as with the amazing coaches and members at Strategic Coach, who provided insights and stories that brought Dan’s ideas and this book to life. I’m lucky and blessed to have such a close connection with Dan and Babs, and to be able to have multiple Zoom calls with Dan for each book we write together. It’s a true pleasure, one I don’t take for granted, and one that was genuinely a dream come true. 首先，我要感谢丹和巴布斯对我的信任，感谢他们把丹的概念和想法告诉我，感谢战略教练的优秀教练和成员，他们提供的见解和故事使丹的想法和这本书栩栩如生。我很幸运，也很幸运能与 Dan 和 Babs 有如此密切的联系，并且能够为我们一起写的每一本书与 Dan 进行多次 Zoom 通话。这是一种真正的快乐，一种我不认为理所当然的快乐，一种真正的梦想成真的快乐。

I’d also like to specifically thank Cathy Davis, Shannon Waller, and Julia Waller of Strategic Coach. You all treat me like family and support me so much! Thank you! 我还要特别感谢战略教练的凯西·戴维斯、香农·沃勒和朱莉娅·沃勒。你们都把我当家人一样，给了我这么多支持！谢谢你，谢谢

A special thanks to Howard Getson, for having many conversations with me throughout the years on these topics. Howard, you are brilliant at 10x-thinking and this book would not have been as clear or powerful without your thoughtful words, encouragement, and insights. 特别感谢霍华德 Getson，多年来与我就这些话题进行了多次对话。霍华德，你在 10 x 思维方面很出色，如果没有你深思熟虑的话，这本书就不会如此清晰或强大，鼓励，和见解。

Big, big thanks to all the Strategic Coach coaches who have given me not only their time, stories, and insights, but their emotional support. Specifically, Chad Johnson, Adrienne Duffy, Kim Butler, Lee Brower, and Colleen Bowler. But also, to the other coaches who invested time, feedback, and any forms of support. You have no idea how much it helped and how much I rely on you to comprehend and express the ideas you all embody and teach masterfully. 非常非常感谢所有的战略教练，他们不仅给了我时间、故事和见解，而且给了我情感上的支持。特别是查德·约翰逊，艾德丽安·达菲，金·巴特勒，李·布劳尔和科琳·鲍勒。但也要感谢其他投入时间、反馈和任何形式支持的教练。你不知道这对我有多大的帮助，我有多依赖你来理解和表达你所体现和巧妙教导的思想。

Also, huge thanks to all of the Strategic Coach members and entrepreneurs I interviewed for this book. Whether your story ended up in the book or not, you helped me so much. Thank you for your love for and brilliant application of these ideas. Hearing your stories helped me more fully comprehend what 10x, Unique Ability, Free Days, and having a Self-Managing Team means. Thanks for your generosity, passion, and love. 此外，非常感谢我为这本书采访的所有战略教练成员和企业家。不管你的故事最终会不会出现在书里，你帮了我很多。感谢您对这些想法的热爱和出色应用。听你的故事帮助我更充分地理解了什么是 10 倍，独特的能力，空闲时间，以及拥有一个自我管理的团队。谢谢你的慷慨、热情和爱。
