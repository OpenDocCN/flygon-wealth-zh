- en: I hate to be the one to have to tell you this, but the American dream is dead.
    The rich get richer and the poor get poorer not because of some fluke, but because
    the system was designed this way—and guess what? Rich people designed it.

  zh: 我很不愿意告诉你这个消息，但美国梦已经死了。富人变得更富，穷人变得更穷不是因为某种偶然，而是因为这个系统是这样设计的—猜猜是谁设计的？富人设计的。
- en: For generations, conversations about investments, money, and wealth were held
    in hushed tones on the sprawling greens of golf courses and over cocktails at
    members-only clubs. The secrets to financial success were traded among friends
    and passed down from “Rich Dads” to their “Rich Sons.”

  zh: 几代人以来，关于投资、金钱和财富的对话在高尔夫球场的广袤绿地上和会员制俱乐部的鸡尾酒会上低声交谈。财务成功的秘诀在朋友之间传递，并从“富有的父亲”传给他们的“富有的儿子”。
- en: Meanwhile, if you weren’t an old, rich, white dude, the financial services industry
    left you out to dry. While these rich dudes were busy creating and maintaining
    generational wealth, the rest of us were being sold the myth of the American dream—that
    if we studied hard, worked overtime, and gave up life’s little luxuries, we’d
    be able to get rich just like the millionaires we saw in the pages of *Forbes*
    and *Vanity Fair*.

- en: For most people, it’s no longer possible to work or save your way to rich. And
    to make matters worse, if you don’t know the rules around money, you simply never
    will, because we’ve been told that talking about money is rude, tacky, and off-limits.

- en: When I started on the J.P. Morgan equities desk in New York City, there were
    about thirty to forty traders and salespeople on the team. If you asked most of
    them why they joined the industry in the first place, I’d bet money that most
    of them would tell you they had a genuine interest . . . in making a shitload

- en: I was no different. I wish I could tell you I had a burning passion for financial
    markets, but in reality, I just wanted a job where I’d never have to ask my parents
    for money ever again. Sure, I wanted to work in a fast-paced environment and get
    to do something new every day, but the idea of a penthouse apartment and a seven-figure
    paycheck definitely didn’t hurt. Ultimately, the job helped me get rich, just
    not in the way that I originally thought it would—and a lot of it is thanks to

    to my 401(k) (I wasn’t), ask if I knew how to use the company’s corporate travel
    catalog to save on hotels (I didn’t), and even buy me lunch every day for nearly
    two years (I couldn’t afford it—even on my fancy salary. I was paying New York

    I never learned within the four walls of a classroom. Not only did she help me
    build a foundation to create financial wellness for myself, but even more importantly,
