    left you out to dry. While these rich dudes were busy creating and maintaining
    generational wealth, the rest of us were being sold the myth of the American dream—that
    if we studied hard, worked overtime, and gave up life’s little luxuries, we’d
    be able to get rich just like the millionaires we saw in the pages of *Forbes*
    and *Vanity Fair*.

    My mission is to make money conversations normal, understandable, and—gasp—enjoyable
    for the next generation of Rich BFFs. Finance has been male, pale, and stale for
    entirely too long, but with this book, I’m turning finance into FUN-ance. I want
    everyone to recognize that they can become financially independent if they’re
    armed with the right information and tools.

    parents—where clipping coupons and reusing ziplock bags was the norm. I was taught
    that becoming rich meant swapping out my name-brand purchases for the store brand
    and packing a brown-bag lunch every day. I was told that if I could just stop
    buying Starbucks I’d be a millionaire in no time . . . right?!

    about thirty to forty traders and salespeople on the team. If you asked most of
    them why they joined the industry in the first place, I’d bet money that most
    of them would tell you they had a genuine interest . . . in making a shitload
    of money. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar.

    for money ever again. Sure, I wanted to work in a fast-paced environment and get
    to do something new every day, but the idea of a penthouse apartment and a seven-figure
    paycheck definitely didn’t hurt. Ultimately, the job helped me get rich, just
    not in the way that I originally thought it would—and a lot of it is thanks to
    *my* Rich BFF.

    my mentor that was the real game changer. For the first time in my life, someone
    was looking out for me. She would pull me aside and ask if I was contributing
    to my 401(k) (I wasn’t), ask if I knew how to use the company’s corporate travel
    catalog to save on hotels (I didn’t), and even buy me lunch every day for nearly
    two years (I couldn’t afford it—even on my fancy salary. I was paying New York
    City rent, people!). From her, I learned invaluable lessons about money, finance,
    and life that I never would have on the trading floor.

    I never learned within the four walls of a classroom. Not only did she help me
    build a foundation to create financial wellness for myself, but even more importantly,
    she became an inspiration: a daily reminder that someone who looked just like
    me—a young Asian woman, from a modest family, with few connections—could make
