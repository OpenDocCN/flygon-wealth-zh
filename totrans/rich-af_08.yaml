    cute little couples getaway, one of those day-drinking, sunbathing, very chill
    kind of mini vacations. One afternoon, before heading to the beach, we swung by
    the local CVS to pick up some snacks, and on the way out my girlfriend stopped
    dead in her tracks.

    game.
  prefs: []

    to the self-checkout. But Lauren was *so* excited, and inevitably her enthusiasm
    rubbed off on me. If my bestie was so excited about this novelty tourist trap
    of a board game, then who was I to rain on her parade?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    were fully stoked. We were *ready* to play this game. We slid back into our seats,
    handing out the goods, and when Adam, Lauren’s boyfriend, asked what we were so
    amped about, I told him, “Oh, Lauren just bought this cheesy Hamptons Monopoly
    game for us to play tonight.”
  prefs: []

    then, from the front seat, Adam turned around. Not smiling. Super intense.

    rent for the hotel on Shelter Island (the Hamptons version of Boardwalk).

    this comes as a surprise. It is probably the quickest and most devastating way
    to push friendships (and any relationship, really) to the brink. But this particular
    session was different, and not just because we were playing Hamptons Monopoly
    instead of the regular version.

    money *you don’t have* to buy property. It turns out that if you do read the rule
    book the whole way through, and understand how the lending system works, the rules
    actually allow you to get leverage with the Monopoly bank (pretty much the same
    way you get rich in real life, TBH), which makes piling up those pink and orange
    bills go *so* much faster.

    want to enjoy. They buy it because it will make them more money. In other words,

    makes them money over time) instead of liabilities (stuff that costs them money

    a two-family duplex. Not exciting, not glamorous, maybe even a little run-down

    They see that the market is making them eight to ten percent a year, while their
    mortgage debt is going up by only two or three percent per year—and the amount
    is shrinking with every payment. The delta between that—the difference they get
    to pocket—is that 8- to 10-percent growth in the market minus the 2 to 3 percent
    in debt, which equals a nice 6 to 7 percent. Which, again, is money they are straight-up

    through appreciation of the property itself, and through freeing up cash to be

    own cash, we existed in a world that was constantly getting turned upside down.
    You didn’t *need* to be an adult with a stock portfolio to see that 9/11, the
    Iraq War, the 2008 housing crisis, Brexit, COVID-19, the January 6 insurrection,
    the FTX fiasco, and the 2023 collapse of major regional and national banks had
    massive, unavoidable effects on the way we live. In fact, *because* we were young
    when many of these things happened, they taught our impressionable kid and teenage
    and twentysomething brains some truths about the world: *It’s volatile. It’s scary.
    It could all be ripped away in a split second.*'

    to live their prime earning years through a bull market (aka when the line goes
    up and to the right and the economy is doing well). Back then, as long as you
    participated in the stock market and bought a diversified portfolio, you won.
    But anyone born from the nineties onward lived through collective trauma—economic
    and otherwise. The ideas we’ve been taught about “how the market works” do not
    match with our lived reality of *how the market actually works.* Call us coddled,
    or sensitive snowflakes, or whatever, but this shit was *real* for us.

    dress code. After food, rent, and other necessities, the best I could afford were
    the cheapies that come in little cardboard boxes at Walgreens for $6.99\. These
    pantyhose *sucked*, y’all. I’d wear each pair two, maybe three times before a
    hangnail snagged one of the legs, or a hole appeared in the crotch, or they just
    got one of those mysterious out-of-nowhere runs. So I’d have to buy more. Over
    about six months, I went through thirteen pairs of those suckers, aka just about
    ninety-one dollars’ worth of pantyhose.

    for the month, and I needed other stuff like “skirts that fit” and “shoes not
    worn down to the heel peg.” So I was stuck buying L’eggs at $6.99 a pop, because
    I *did* have $6.99\. I was overpaying in the long term—not because I was “making
    bad choices” but because I was too cash-strapped to have an alternative. (If you’ve
    ever read Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series, you might be familiar with Captain
    Samuel Vimes’s observations about cheap boots versus expensive boots. I was basically
    living out my own version, but with pantyhose.)

- en: The abolition of slavery in the United States was supposed to usher in freedom
    and equality under the law, but the (white) (male) people in power just innovated
    new ways to discriminate. Eight generations after the first Juneteenth, the typical
    Black American family has only thirteen cents for every dollar held by the typical
    white American family. Black veterans were denied benefits of the GI Bill, such
    as free college tuition. And Black families would face redlining and racist lending
    policies when attempting to buy homes, effectively locking them out of the postwar
    economic boom.

    denying Black people the ability to move upward economically. Today, Black women
    in the United States are still paid 36 percent less than white men and 12 percent
    less than white women. They’re also 10 percent less likely than white men to be
    an active part of the workforce. Black people who are homeowners get less resale
    value for their homes—just because Black people lived there! (Seriously: a Black
    family in California swapped out their family photos with photos of a white friend’s
    family, and their home appraisal went up by HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. For the *same.

    divided racial group in the country: in 2016, Asians in the top tenth percentile
    earned over ten times as much as those in the bottom tenth percentile. This is
    at least partially due to American immigration laws, specifically the H-1B visa
    that allowed US employers to employ foreign workers in high-earning specialty
    occupations—think doctors, computer scientists, engineers—which led to many highly
