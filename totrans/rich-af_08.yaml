- en: A while back, I was spending a long weekend in the Hamptons with some friends—a
    cute little couples getaway, one of those day-drinking, sunbathing, very chill
    kind of mini vacations. One afternoon, before heading to the beach, we swung by
    the local CVS to pick up some snacks, and on the way out my girlfriend stopped
    dead in her tracks.

  zh: 不久前，我和一些朋友在汉普顿度过了一个长周末——一个可爱的小情侣度假，那种喝酒、晒太阳、非常轻松的迷你假期。一个下午，在去海滩之前，我们顺便去当地的CVS买了些零食，当我女朋友在出门时突然停住脚步。

- en: The secret was basically a weird loophole in the rules that allows you to use
    money *you don’t have* to buy property. It turns out that if you do read the rule
    book the whole way through, and understand how the lending system works, the rules
    actually allow you to get leverage with the Monopoly bank (pretty much the same
    way you get rich in real life, TBH), which makes piling up those pink and orange
    bills go *so* much faster.

    a rate of around 2 percent per year to be “healthy” and indicative of an economy
    that’s growing steadily. (Negative inflation, or *deflation*, is actually its
    own kind of bad news.) More than that, though, can be bad news—and lately, that’s
    just what’s been happening. The still-ongoing aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic
    that caught tons of companies, banks, and manufacturers by surprise; the sporadic
    supply chain issues that keep cropping up; the labor market wildin’ out as people
    are laid off, retire early, and come *out* of retirement; and the general *instability*
