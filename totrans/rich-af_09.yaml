    that’s low risk and low barrier to entry. For example, signing up for a Wag account
    and walking someone’s dog? Low risk—doesn’t cost you much in terms of initial
    startup costs and easy to cut your losses and quit if it doesn’t work out. Mowing
    lawns and pulling weeds? You’ve gotta have that lawn mower, and maybe some work
    gloves, but still pretty low-ish startup costs (especially if you already own
    a mower). Babysitting? Doesn’t cost you anything—you just show up to that person’s
    house.

    side hustle out to see if you actually like doing it, right? For example, if you

    time to do it for forty hours a week, and if you don’t do it for forty hours a
    week, you’re not going to make what you thought you were going to make . . . well,
