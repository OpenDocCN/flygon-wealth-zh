    people, and having advocates beside *and* above me really made a difference. If

- en: This works so much better for two reasons. For one, asking for a raise is like
    planning a vacation. If you want to go to the Bahamas in December, when *everyone
    else* is dying to go to a white-sand beach, you are not going to get a good deal
    if you wait until November 31 to book your tickets. No, you need to be buying
    your flights and snapping up a hotel room in June, when no one else is thinking
    about December travel, because that’s when it’s easier, that’s when it’s cheaper,
    and that’s when the deals are to be had. In other words, if you ask for money
    when every single person on your team is asking for money, you can easily get
    lost on that long, long list. What you *want* is for your boss to always be thinking
    about *you* when it comes to raises, promotions, or really any opportunity. And
    the easiest way to do that is to ask for them in that “offseason.”
  id: totrans-150

  zh: 这种方法之所以更有效，有两个原因。首先，要求涨薪就像计划度假一样。如果你想在十二月去巴哈马，当*每个人*都渴望去白沙滩时，如果你等到十一月31日才订票，你是不会得到好的交易的。不，你需要在六月购买机票，预订酒店房间，当没有人考虑十二月旅行时，因为那时更容易，更便宜，更有优惠。换句话说，如果你在每个团队成员都在要求加薪时要求加薪，你很容易在那长长的名单中迷失。你*想要*的是，当涉及到加薪、晋升或任何机会时，你的老板总是想着*你*。而最简单的方法就是在那个“淡季”要求它们。
- en: No, you don’t have to hit your boss up every week. Don’t be *annoying*, but
    ask to meet in thoughtful intervals, genuinely bring something to discuss in terms
    of your performance, and they will be more likely to remember you when it actually
    counts.

  zh: 不，你不必每周都找你的老板。不要*烦人*，但是要有规律地要求见面，真诚地带来一些关于你表现的讨论内容，这样当真正重要时，他们更有可能记住你。
- en: The other thing is that, as I mentioned earlier, there’s a budget for raises.
    And the budget decisions are not made in that annual review meeting you have with
    your boss. They are made months in advance. By the time those conversations are
    happening, your boss already has an idea of what they’re going to grant you—if
    anything. So if they have already seen throughout the year that you’ve been . . .
    not *annoying* about that raise, but let’s say *persistent*, by the time you get
    to the end of your review and you bring up money, they’re that much more likely
    to say, “Cool, I’m going to cut you off right there. I already got it for you,
    so it’s all good.”
  id: totrans-152
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 另一件事是，正如我之前提到的，涨薪有一个预算。而这些预算决定并不是在你和老板进行的年度审查会议上做出的。这些决定是提前几个月就做出的。当这些对话发生时，你的老板已经有了一个关于他们将给予你什么（如果有的话）的想法。所以如果他们在整年中已经看到你一直在 . . .
    不是*烦人*地要求加薪，而是说*坚持*，当你在审查结束时提出加薪时，他们更有可能说，“好的，我会在这里打住。我已经为你准备好了，所以一切都好。”
