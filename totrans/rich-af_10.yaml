    weeks—months—and I was literally sweating at the boutique when it was time to
    actually buy it. I had worked my ass off for it—not just *at* that Wall Street
    job, but to get that job in the first place, and now I was reaping the luxurious
    fruits of my labor in the form of this gorgeous designer piece. By the time I
    swiped my card at the register, I knew I had earned every stitch on that bag.
    I was trading blood, sweat, and tears for Saffiano leather. And I swear, in that
    moment, I really felt like I had made it. I was legit thinking, *Yes, I am the
    American dream*. When I carried it around in public, when I got a compliment on
    it, I felt a sense of pride precisely because I *knew* how hard I had worked to
    afford that bag.

    premiums in the same medical category as copays and cold medicine, or you could
    create an insurance category that also includes your car insurance and homeowner’s
    or renter’s insurance. (If you’re using the Your Rich BFF spreadsheet, I’ve included

    much of a necessity that set of expenses is as a group. I do also suggest avoiding

    you see how much you’ve spent on DoorDash, or you’re *still* grinning over the

    night, that “Who am I going to pick?” feeling is you anticipating opportunity
    cost. Because you know if you go out with Cutie #1 and they turn out to be boring
    or gross or secretly a terrible person, you’re going to spend the whole night
    thinking *Ughhhh, what a waste of my life, I can’t believe I shaved my legs for

    That’s pretty much it. You don’t figure out how much to save alongside figuring
    out how much to spend on wants and needs (like 50/30/20) and you don’t zero down
    your paychecks in any old order (like zero-based budgeting). It’s a “reverse”

    budgeting gets your money out of sight and out of mind—especially if you’re paying

    habit going. Getting in that groove makes it so much easier to sustain over the

    half of every month, because even though I knew I was going to get a paycheck,
    it basically all had to go to rent. Yet for whatever reason, it felt *less* bad
    to set aside half of that *first* paycheck for rent, live off the other half of
    that first paycheck for two weeks, and then cover the rest of the rent with half
    of that second paycheck and still have another half paycheck to ride out the end
    of the month. Something about not having to rip the entire rent money out of one
    paycheck made me *feel* so much more competent and on top of things—and not feeling
    broke made it that much easier to live within my means with those two half paychecks
    for expenses.
