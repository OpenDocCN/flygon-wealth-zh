    fruits of my labor in the form of this gorgeous designer piece. By the time I
    swiped my card at the register, I knew I had earned every stitch on that bag.
    I was trading blood, sweat, and tears for Saffiano leather. And I swear, in that
    moment, I really felt like I had made it. I was legit thinking, *Yes, I am the

    you could create a home maintenance category—or you could choose to lump your
    light bulbs and shower curtains under housing. You could put health insurance
    premiums in the same medical category as copays and cold medicine, or you could
    create an insurance category that also includes your car insurance and homeowner’s
    or renter’s insurance. (If you’re using the Your Rich BFF spreadsheet, I’ve included
    a starter set of categories ready to go, but you can def get in there and change

- en: Whatever categories you end up with, keep in mind that the main goal is just
    to see at a glance where your money is going. What’s most important about any
    individual category isn’t so much what kind of thing you’re spending on, but how
    much of a necessity that set of expenses is as a group. I do also suggest avoiding
    having too big of a miscellaneous category, because that sort of defeats the purpose

    it reminds you that *you* are the one who gets to make the judgment calls, because

    and investment accounts before making literally any other spending decisions.
    That’s pretty much it. You don’t figure out how much to save alongside figuring
    out how much to spend on wants and needs (like 50/30/20) and you don’t zero down
    your paychecks in any old order (like zero-based budgeting). It’s a “reverse”
    method because your very *first* move is putting money in savings and investments
    (instead of just saving however much is left after expenses).

    if you’re one of those so-called savers who puts a few bucks in a savings account
    at the end of the month only to transfer it all back out a week later. Reverse
    budgeting gets your money out of sight and out of mind—especially if you’re paying
    yourself first into a retirement account, where that money is effectively locked
    away until you’re much older (and more on that in chapter 5!).

    habit going. Getting in that groove makes it so much easier to sustain over the
    long run. And smallish contributions may not feel like much now, but they can
    definitely add up over time (hello, compound interest!) and make you richer almost

    get paid twice a month. Basically, you split the cost of your bills into two lump

    second paycheck covers the other half.

    It definitely was for me. I fell in love with half-payment budgeting pretty soon
    after I moved to New York and found myself getting really bummed out in the second
    half of every month, because even though I knew I was going to get a paycheck,
    it basically all had to go to rent. Yet for whatever reason, it felt *less* bad
    to set aside half of that *first* paycheck for rent, live off the other half of
    that first paycheck for two weeks, and then cover the rest of the rent with half
    of that second paycheck and still have another half paycheck to ride out the end
    of the month. Something about not having to rip the entire rent money out of one
    paycheck made me *feel* so much more competent and on top of things—and not feeling
    broke made it that much easier to live within my means with those two half paychecks
    for expenses.

    even think of it like writing a paper in college: if you know that your teacher
    is giving you a week to write it, you *could* spend six days avoiding the assignment
    and then bang out a shitty essay that you submit at 11:58 p.m. on deadline day.
    Or you could write half the paper in the first three days of the week, and then
    the second half of the paper in the back three days—and still have one day off

    Your life itself will change, too—you buy a house, you have a kid, and maybe two
    grand spent on new furniture or a bougie stroller now feels *way* more valuable
    to you than two grand spent on shoes. Even something as quick as a sudden rainstorm
    can change how valuable a purchase is for you—maybe you’d never pay twenty bucks
    for a rinky-dink drugstore umbrella ordinarily, but if you just got your hair
    done and it starts pouring rain, that twenty dollars is now money well spent.

    is ultimately just a set of boundaries for yourself—but it’s hard to respect those
    if everyone around you is pushing, pushing, pushing on them. Even if you’re not

    money,” it affects your role in your family, *especially* if you come from a family
