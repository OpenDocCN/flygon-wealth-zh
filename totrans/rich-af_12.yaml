    giving the bank or credit union a loan. They will then turn around and lend that
    money out to people, and you better believe they’re charging those people interest.
    Then, to pay you for parking your money there, banks (at least traditional brick-and-mortar
    banks) will pay you on average about 0.07 percent in interest each year—meaning
    if you put $100 into a savings account, after one year you’d have a balance of
    $100.07\. And since the bank is paying you literal pennies compared to the interest
    rates they charge when they lend out your money, they really, *really* need you

    firm FI Works, the acquisition cost on a financial services account can be as
    high as five hundred bucks per customer (which is *way* higher than acquisition
    costs for other consumer industries, incidentally). And since it’s so expensive
    for the bank to get you on board in the first place, it’s also really expensive
    to *lose* you as a customer. If you move all your money to a different bank, they’re

    builds a platform over an existing bank’s infrastructure, the actual bank holds
    the deposits, and the neobank pays it out of the money it gets on things like
    interchange fees (which a merchant pays whenever you swipe your debit or credit
    card) or ATM fees (when you withdraw cash). As you can probably guess, this means
    those fees tend to be higher as compared to a traditional bank so that the neobank

- en: Traditional savings accounts—the ones you get through your standard bank or
    credit union—typically pay interest, but as we’ve seen, it’s often not very much
    (literal pennies on the dollar, remember?). Meanwhile, high-yield savings accounts
    (HYSAs) are out there being like, “This could be us but you playin’.” A HYSA will
    pay up to ten times as much as a traditional savings account in interest annually.
    Right now (as I’m writing this), HYSAs are paying anywhere from 4 to 5 percent
    interest—so four-ish dollars on every hundred dollars saved. And four bucks can
    buy you, like, a whole pack of gum!

    HYSAs每年支付的利息最多可是传统储蓄账户的十倍。就在现在（我写这篇文章时），HYSAs支付的利息从4%到5%不等——所以每存100美元就能赚大约四美元。四美元可以买到，比如，一整包口香糖！

    when financial institutions that have not traditionally been brick-and-mortar
    consumer banks—SoFi, Goldman Sachs, American Express, and Ally, to name a few—decided
    to offer a new generation of savings account to build up their user base. This
    means they’re (1) willing to pay up more in exchange for parking your money there
    and (2) set up with the exact same rules as traditional savings accounts (like
    you can only make six transactions a month, for example) and are FDIC insured
    (so your money is safe in the event the bank fails). As a bonus, since a lot of
    them are digital-first, and they’re catering to younger audiences who prefer to
    do their banking from the comfort of their cell phone, they’ve invested in really
    solid apps and tech experiences.

    For purchases that you can make basically whenever, like a new bag, it’s up to

    up in a modest middle- or working-class community, when you *don’t* get that positive
    entitlement from pampering and a “you’re worth it, babe” environment that comes
    with being rich, when you’ve never really seen anyone who looks like you succeed
    and make a ton of money, of course you’re going to doubt your ability to do it.

- en: And when you’re a broke-slash-poor person, you are likely poor in terms of money
    (duh) but also probably poor in terms of time. You’re chained to your job that
    you probably don’t like for most of “business hours.” You spend a good chunk of
    your “free” time commuting and running errands. You don’t have the freedom to
    leave your desk at 1:00 p.m. to go argue with someone at the bank. So when that
    surprise fee hits . . . you’ll just suck it up and pay it, because figuring out
    how to fight it is going to take too much time and energy that you just don’t
    have.

  zh: 当你是一位贫穷的人时，你可能在金钱方面贫穷（显然），但在时间方面也可能贫穷。你被锁定在你可能不喜欢的工作中大部分“工作时间”。你花费大部分“空闲”时间通勤和办事。你没有自由在下午1点离开你的办公桌去和银行的某人争论。所以当那笔意外费用出现时……你只能忍受并支付，因为弄清楚如何对抗它将花费你根本没有的太多时间和精力。

    not going to exercise any entitlement, because that seems like something for other

    for that matter, who are not a woman, a queer person, or a person of color like
    you.
