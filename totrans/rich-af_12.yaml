    giving the bank or credit union a loan. They will then turn around and lend that
    money out to people, and you better believe they’re charging those people interest.
    Then, to pay you for parking your money there, banks (at least traditional brick-and-mortar
    banks) will pay you on average about 0.07 percent in interest each year—meaning
    if you put $100 into a savings account, after one year you’d have a balance of
    $100.07\. And since the bank is paying you literal pennies compared to the interest

    builds a platform over an existing bank’s infrastructure, the actual bank holds
    the deposits, and the neobank pays it out of the money it gets on things like
    interchange fees (which a merchant pays whenever you swipe your debit or credit
    card) or ATM fees (when you withdraw cash). As you can probably guess, this means
    those fees tend to be higher as compared to a traditional bank so that the neobank

    (HYSAs) are out there being like, “This could be us but you playin’.” A HYSA will
    pay up to ten times as much as a traditional savings account in interest annually.
    Right now (as I’m writing this), HYSAs are paying anywhere from 4 to 5 percent
    interest—so four-ish dollars on every hundred dollars saved. And four bucks can
    buy you, like, a whole pack of gum!

    one thing that makes you rich, but IMO, there is no reason *not* to have one:
    it is probably the easiest, quickest way to put yourself on a better financial
    path. You will literally just put money into the account and they will pay you

    when financial institutions that have not traditionally been brick-and-mortar
    consumer banks—SoFi, Goldman Sachs, American Express, and Ally, to name a few—decided
    to offer a new generation of savings account to build up their user base. This
    means they’re (1) willing to pay up more in exchange for parking your money there
    and (2) set up with the exact same rules as traditional savings accounts (like
    you can only make six transactions a month, for example) and are FDIC insured
    (so your money is safe in the event the bank fails). As a bonus, since a lot of
    them are digital-first, and they’re catering to younger audiences who prefer to
    do their banking from the comfort of their cell phone, they’ve invested in really
    solid apps and tech experiences.

    offer both high-yield savings and high-yield checking accounts, so if one of those

- en: If your emergency fund is for when shit hits the fan unexpectedly, a sinking
    fund is a savings account you’ll use to pay for costs, expenses, and purchases
    you are planning on. You don’t plan to cut off part of your finger and have to
    go to the hospital, but you do plan to go on vacation, have a wedding, or buy
    a car. In other words, sinking funds are where you stash your money for big-ticket
    items or expenses—things you’re opting in to.
  id: totrans-132
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sinking funds are the best way to pay for things that you want to buy at some
    point in the relatively near future, for a few reasons. First of all, breaking
    up the amount you need to save into smaller chunks that you contribute to monthly
    (or however often) helps you see that you’re making progress. When I was saving
    up for that surprise cruise for my folks, or even for my Prada bag, I felt *way*
    less sticker shock because I knew the final price ahead of time (precisely) and
    I felt like I was always making progress toward it even though it would take me
    time to get all the way there.

- en: Second of all, sinking funds truly give your dollars a job. When you know that
    money is sitting in a savings account specifically for the purpose of surrounding
    you and your spouse-to-be with gorgeous floral arrangements at your dream wedding,
    it’s a lot easier to leave it there instead of raiding the account to pay for
    smaller stuff you don’t actually *really* want as much. Sinking funds operate
    based on a value-based spending mindset and roll it into a zero-based budget approach.
  id: totrans-134
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The math behind sinking funds is pretty simple: how much the thing costs divided
    by how much time until you plan to buy the thing. For big expenses with a firm
    start date, like a cruise or a wedding, that time horizon will be pretty well-defined.
    For purchases that you can make basically whenever, like a new bag, it’s up to
    you to pick your “deadline” and then fine-tune it based on the amount you’d need
    to save every month—if socking away $500 every month isn’t possible right now,
    but $250 would be manageable, then just plan on taking twice as long to save up.
    Alternatively, you can work backward from how much you’re able to put into a sinking
    fund each month, then multiply that out to figure out how long until you’ll have
    the dollars needed to pick it up.'

- en: Besides vacations, weddings, and designer accessories, sinking funds are a great
    way to set money aside for Big Adult Purchases like a car or even the down payment
    on a home. Generally, though, I suggest you pick expenses that are coming up in
    the next six months to a year. Longer than that and (1) it starts to feel so far
    off that you lose the sense of purpose you’re getting by giving your dollars a
    job and (2) you might be better off investing to make that money earn more money
    (and we’ll get to that).

    with its own particular job.

    thought: that even though a few dollars here and there is not a lot of money per
    se, it can and does add up over time. It’s the “death by a thousand papercuts”
    view of saving. Going back to that daily latte example, five bucks every day for
    coffee works out to be a touch shy of $2,000 at the end of the year. And two G’s
    is a lot of money! It’s a modest vacation, it’s a not-too-shabby wardrobe makeover,
    it’s a dinner out every other week.'

    habitual choices add up over time, and can small cutbacks to your daily budget
    put you in a better financial position than you would be otherwise? Yeah, duh!
    But does that make any *one* small purchase inherently problematic? No. It’s just
    that making enough of those small purchases may prevent you from making major
    purchases down the line—ones that are much, much more valuable to you, and more
    important to your life. In other words, while one five-dollar coffee is not going
    to be the difference between whether or not you can buy a home, a daily five-dollar
    coffee over the course of twelve months *could* be the difference between whether
    or not you get to buy a new laptop at the end of the year.

    large purchases—because this works only if you negotiate every single time, are
    very aggressive in your negotiation, and end up paying as little as humanly possible
    for those major expenses. Since those bigger purchases have bigger price tags,
    even a small comedown in price makes a big difference in dollars saved.

    places have a business model in the first place. This bank or that credit union
    is not doing you a favor allowing you to have an account there—you are literally
    giving them a near interest-free loan every time you deposit a check there.

    you’re actively self-advocating or even just thinking “I am worth it,” you need
    to literally go against your gut and do something that feels so terrifying for
    you to get in this mindset. So, sure, it’s not gonna feel normal the first time.
    It’s not gonna feel good. It’s gonna feel scary. You’re probably gonna have your
    heart beating out of your chest and your palms super sweaty and gross.

    or applying for mortgages, it’s okay to do what you’re doing. You’re worthy of
    this product and this service—you’re worthy of *good* service. You can stick up
    for what you’re entitled to and be firm, *and* you can be polite. You can go for
    that win-win where they get the commission, you get the interest rate, and everyone’s
    happy. You do ten minutes of googling to find a better deal or you can literally
    just ask for perks or upgrades or bonuses—sometimes that’s all it takes. You can
    remember that negotiation is an option, even for you. You can trust that there’s
    more where that came from for you—because there is.
