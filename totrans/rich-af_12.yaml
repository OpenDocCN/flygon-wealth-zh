    giving the bank or credit union a loan. They will then turn around and lend that
    money out to people, and you better believe they’re charging those people interest.
    Then, to pay you for parking your money there, banks (at least traditional brick-and-mortar
    banks) will pay you on average about 0.07 percent in interest each year—meaning
    if you put $100 into a savings account, after one year you’d have a balance of
    $100.07\. And since the bank is paying you literal pennies compared to the interest
    rates they charge when they lend out your money, they really, *really* need you

    aka what a bank pays across freebies, commercials, influencer deals, and marketing
    campaigns to bring in a new customer. According to research by the consumer data
    firm FI Works, the acquisition cost on a financial services account can be as
    high as five hundred bucks per customer (which is *way* higher than acquisition
    costs for other consumer industries, incidentally). And since it’s so expensive
    for the bank to get you on board in the first place, it’s also really expensive
    to *lose* you as a customer. If you move all your money to a different bank, they’re

    checking accounts are elsewhere. Take a look at what bonuses or goodies your fave

    accounts for rent, food, fun, and so on. If you’re trying half-payment budgeting,
    you can have just two, one for each half. All you have to do is spend out of those

    different banks you can leverage in the future for things like mortgages and loans,
    and it just gets you comfortable with being HBIC of your own financial domain.

    amounts until it gets spent on bills and expenses, your *savings* dollars might
    total up to thousands upon thousands, right? And we don’t just want all that savings

    credit union—typically pay interest, but as we’ve seen, it’s often not very much
    (literal pennies on the dollar, remember?). Meanwhile, high-yield savings accounts
    (HYSAs) are out there being like, “This could be us but you playin’.” A HYSA will
    pay up to ten times as much as a traditional savings account in interest annually.
    Right now (as I’m writing this), HYSAs are paying anywhere from 4 to 5 percent
    interest—so four-ish dollars on every hundred dollars saved. And four bucks can
    buy you, like, a whole pack of gum!
  prefs: []

    one thing that makes you rich, but IMO, there is no reason *not* to have one:
    it is probably the easiest, quickest way to put yourself on a better financial
    path. You will literally just put money into the account and they will pay you
    interest, and that is free money you didn’t have before. It’s very, very, very
    simple.'

    when financial institutions that have not traditionally been brick-and-mortar
    consumer banks—SoFi, Goldman Sachs, American Express, and Ally, to name a few—decided
    to offer a new generation of savings account to build up their user base. This
    means they’re (1) willing to pay up more in exchange for parking your money there
    and (2) set up with the exact same rules as traditional savings accounts (like
    you can only make six transactions a month, for example) and are FDIC insured
    (so your money is safe in the event the bank fails). As a bonus, since a lot of
    them are digital-first, and they’re catering to younger audiences who prefer to
    do their banking from the comfort of their cell phone, they’ve invested in really
    solid apps and tech experiences.
  prefs: []

    will probably be with different financial institutions. I promise you, it’s *way*
    less hassle than it sounds like *and* it’s worth it. (Although some banks now
    offer both high-yield savings and high-yield checking accounts, so if one of those
    suits your checking account needs, go for it! I’ve got a list of options at [richAF.club](https://richAF.club).)
    Even a middle-of-the-pack high-yield savings account is still *so* much better

    like with checking accounts, we can give every savings account we have a job.
    For savings, an account’s job will fall into either *emergency fund* or *sinking
    fund* territory. An emergency fund is a savings account with money set aside for
    covering unforeseen, uh, emergencies (like slicing off your fingertip). A sinking
    fund, on the other hand, is a savings account with money set aside for specific
    big expenses (like a fancy cruise for Mom and Dad . . . or yourself). Let’s break

    your financial life. Whether it’s a tire falling off your car or your roof caving
    in, or your dog eating a chocolate bar, life has a way of serving up situations
    that make you need money that you wouldn’t typically spend. By having an emergency
    fund in a savings account that can be accessed at any time (instead of tied up
    in investments), you are able to protect yourself from the financial stress of
    covering those emergencies.

    month per person and therefore *awesome* for New York. So my twenty-three-year-old
    emergency fund was based on that housing expense, plus all my other monthly necessities.
    But at twenty-six, I was out of the studio and now splitting a monthly rent payment
    of $5,000 with my partner ($2,500 him, $2,500 me), meaning my “three months” of
    living expenses saved up were now a month short. No big: all I had to do was prioritize
    filling up that e-fund a bit more with the savings portion of my budget, and after
    a few months I was back where I needed to be.'

    fund is a savings account you’ll use to pay for costs, expenses, and purchases
    you are planning on. You don’t plan to cut off part of your finger and have to
    go to the hospital, but you do plan to go on vacation, have a wedding, or buy
    a car. In other words, sinking funds are where you stash your money for big-ticket
    items or expenses—things you’re opting in to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sinking funds are the best way to pay for things that you want to buy at some
    point in the relatively near future, for a few reasons. First of all, breaking
    up the amount you need to save into smaller chunks that you contribute to monthly
    (or however often) helps you see that you’re making progress. When I was saving
    up for that surprise cruise for my folks, or even for my Prada bag, I felt *way*
    less sticker shock because I knew the final price ahead of time (precisely) and
    I felt like I was always making progress toward it even though it would take me
    time to get all the way there.
  prefs: []

- en: Second of all, sinking funds truly give your dollars a job. When you know that
    money is sitting in a savings account specifically for the purpose of surrounding
    you and your spouse-to-be with gorgeous floral arrangements at your dream wedding,
    it’s a lot easier to leave it there instead of raiding the account to pay for
    smaller stuff you don’t actually *really* want as much. Sinking funds operate
    based on a value-based spending mindset and roll it into a zero-based budget approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The math behind sinking funds is pretty simple: how much the thing costs divided
    by how much time until you plan to buy the thing. For big expenses with a firm
    start date, like a cruise or a wedding, that time horizon will be pretty well-defined.
    For purchases that you can make basically whenever, like a new bag, it’s up to
    you to pick your “deadline” and then fine-tune it based on the amount you’d need
    to save every month—if socking away $500 every month isn’t possible right now,
    but $250 would be manageable, then just plan on taking twice as long to save up.
    Alternatively, you can work backward from how much you’re able to put into a sinking
    fund each month, then multiply that out to figure out how long until you’ll have
    the dollars needed to pick it up.'

    way to set money aside for Big Adult Purchases like a car or even the down payment
    on a home. Generally, though, I suggest you pick expenses that are coming up in
    the next six months to a year. Longer than that and (1) it starts to feel so far
    off that you lose the sense of purpose you’re getting by giving your dollars a
    job and (2) you might be better off investing to make that money earn more money
    (and we’ll get to that).

    view of saving. Going back to that daily latte example, five bucks every day for

    that making enough of those small purchases may prevent you from making major
    purchases down the line—ones that are much, much more valuable to you, and more
    important to your life. In other words, while one five-dollar coffee is not going
    to be the difference between whether or not you can buy a home, a daily five-dollar

    actually *want* to cancel just yet. Don’t worry! If you’re dealing with a major
    corporation, your account will never get canceled until *you* say the final word.
    You can negotiate for hours and walk away, and the worst case there is that you’re
    back where you started. The secret pro tip is that as soon as you say the magic
    word—“cancel”—you will likely be switched to customer retention (the department
    that will try to, well, retain you as a customer) instead of cancellations. They’re
    not letting you go *that* easy.

    they have the time to go out of their way. They can afford to be inconvenienced,
    not just in terms of cash, but in terms of time and effort. They are rich in money
    *and* rich in time. Maybe they are making a lot of their money from investments
    and therefore don’t *have* to be at work with their boss breathing down their
    neck all day, and/or they’re working a prestigious white-collar job that gives
    them max flexibility. They can literally walk out of their office at 1:00 p.m.,
    say, “Hey, I’m going to step out for lunch, be back whenever,” and then go harass
    the poor customer service person at some bank to inform them in no uncertain terms,
