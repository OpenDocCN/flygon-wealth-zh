    paperwork involved in setting up your investment accounts, but on the more “we
    aren’t taught about this in school” level of things, the world of investment accounts
    feels complicated because no one in charge has an incentive to make it easier.
    In my friend’s case, the process to set up his employer-sponsored 401(k) account
    was such a pain in the ass that he put it off basically forever. That sucked for
    *him*, because he was missing out on investment returns and tax benefits, but
    you know who it didn’t suck for?

    why it was a good idea in the first place?

    health-care specialist on the desk who took a liking to me, and after I showed
    up one morning with a donut and a coffee for him—you know, just cuz—and thanked
    him for all his help, he just so happened to offer me thirty minutes to practice
    my biotech presentation with him. And after drilling it, answering all his questions,

    are earning you a return.” If you have a positive delta—if your investment earnings
    are bigger than your debt interest payments—you’ll *make money* over the long
    term. Yes, even if you’re still technically “in debt.” Think of it like a bucket
    of water with a leak in it: the water might be trickling out at the bottom drip
    by drip (your debt interest rate), but if you’re pouring more water in from a
    high-powered hose (your investment returns), the bucket will still get fuller

    on average, flow into your bucket (aka your investment account).'
  prefs: []

    because we have decades and decades of historical data that can show us how much,
    on average, the market tends to grow over time, in the form of a single handy
    number. That magic number? 7 percent. Seven percent is based on the average return
    on the S&P 500 over the past thirty years.[[*]](24_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1 "footnote")
    Why the S&P 500? Because the S&P 500 comprises the five hundred biggest companies
    trading stock in the United States, and is therefore considered a reliable measure
    of how fast the economy, overall, grows over time. How does that get us 7 percent?
    By calculating those five hundred companies’ performance over a nice long chunk
    of time (like thirty years), accounting for inflation (ofc), and estimating averages
    on the low end of the range (just to be on the safe side), we arrive at a “hose
    rate” of 7 percent. In other words, some years the water (money) from your investments
    might trickle in around 3 percent, and other years it might dump in at 20 percent,
    but on average over time—because time is key!—you can reasonably count on 7 percent
    “inflow” per year.

    a look at your debts—the rate of leakage out of your bucket. You want to see which
    debt is losing you money *too* fast (the biggest leaks in the bucket) and which
    debt is trickling away slowly enough that you can more than replace it with your
    hose. In other words, you’ll figure out which of your debts has higher than a
    7 percent interest rate—and *those* are debts that you’ll need to pay off before
    you can start investing.

    remaining debt *while also* investing and you’ve essentially created a money printer.
    The delta between those two rates is just additional money in your pocket: extra
    money to pay off your debt faster, or to help you invest more. Either way, extra

    the two is that 401(k)s are available to employees of private companies, and 403(b)s
    are for public-sector or nonprofit employees like teachers, government workers,
    and so on. (The letter-number names come from the parts of the US tax code that
    governs how these accounts are administered.)

    contributions to your 401(k) or 403(b) are made *pretax*. Those dollars can go
    directly from your employer to your investment account, and they *won’t* count
    as money you earned for the year—meaning you’re paying taxes on less money overall,
    and therefore landing a smaller tax bill at the end of the year.

    401(k)/403(b) until age 59.5 without paying a steep penalty—that’s the government’s
    way of saying *no touchy*. And you can’t just dump *all* your money in every year
    (the government still wants you paying *some* taxes, after all): there’s an annual
    contribution limit of $22,500 (the limit as of 2023; the limit often increases
    annually to keep up with the cost of living). But as we’ll see, compared to other
    tax-incentivized accounts, that limit is *preeeeetty* high.'

    offers a dollar-for-dollar 401(k) match on any contributions you make, capped
    to 6 percent of your salary (this is what my employer gave at my first job, FWIW).
    That means if you put 6 percent of your salary—so $6,000—away in your 401(k),
    at the end of the year, your account will have your 6 percent contribution *plus*
    a matching amount from your employer—so $12,000 total.

    for employees. Quick history lesson: back in the day, companies used to give out
    pensions and pay for *everything* for their employees once they retired. But it
    wasn’t really working out for the companies, because they were bearing all the
    risk for paying that out (and if one VP lives to 105, they could be on the hook
    for a *lot* of hefty pension payments). Gradually, more and more companies were
    like, “Hey, what if we had our *employees* take most of the risk? They’re the
    ones retiring, after all!” and switched to 401(k)s, where the burden is on *you*
    to take action and contribute. But, because they (and the government) are still
    trying to incentivize you to save for retirement, companies will typically give
    you some free money to put in that investment account in the form of an employer
    match.'
  prefs: []

    still offer pensions!) but even if yours doesn’t match, you can still get that
    tax break. Plus, 401(k)s and 403(b)s are generally protected from creditors in
    case you find yourself in some kind of financial hot water, and some company plans
    allow you to take a loan out from your retirement investment account under certain
    circumstances (such as buying a house), which will be penalty-free as long as
    you repay it within a set time frame.

    investment accounts are designed, regulated, and administered with an eye toward
    *getting people to retire comfortably*, it’s in no one’s best interest (least
    of all yours) to be able to chuck the money at whatever super-risky investment
    you feel like and potentially lose all of your money. Going back to our tote bag

    options—that your company provides. (I highly suggest, if you have a 401(k) or
    403(b), digging up that prospectus to reference when we get to talking types of
    funds in the next section. That will help you understand what’s best for *you*

    your money for when you retire. Like 401(k)s and 403(b)s, there’s a yearly contribution
    limit ($6,500 as of this writing, with a “catch-up” contribution limit of $7,500
    if you’re over fifty years old) and you can’t withdraw your earnings from an IRA
    until you reach age 59.5—or, rather, you *can* withdraw those earnings, but you’ll
    pay capital gains tax on that money, and an early withdrawal penalty to boot.
    Remember how the government taxes stuff it doesn’t want you doing? It super does
    not want you touching this money until It’s Your Time. But by the same token,
    you also get a tax advantage to sweeten the deal . . . and that’s where we get
    to this traditional versus Roth situation.

    be clear.) That’s because a traditional IRA lets you take advantage of all the
    amazing tax benefits up front. The amount you contribute to a traditional IRA
    is deducted from your taxable income for the year you make those contributions.
    So, for a very simplified example, if you make $70,000 this year but put $6,500
    into a traditional IRA, your taxable income would go down to $63,500 ($70,000
    – $6,500). Less income counted = less money paid to the IRS.

    when things get spicy.

    because I am taking this metaphor *way* too far.) With a Roth IRA, you don’t get
    to deduct your contributions from your income this year and save on taxes today.
    *But*, when you start taking distributions from the account in retirement, those
    distributions will be 100 percent tax-free, baby.

    don’t remember all of these different definitions, if you can tattoo it on your
    brain that “Roth = tax at the front, not at the end,” you’re good as far as retirement
    account wisdom goes. (401(k)s can also come in Roth varieties, too–whether or

    sense to take advantage of that up-front tax break when your taxes are likely
    to be higher relative to your income, aka when you earn more money. If the opposite
    is true—that you think you’ll be earning *more* money when you retire than you

    of other factors that might influence which one you pick—for example, reducing
    your taxable income with a traditional IRA might make sense if you’re on an income-based
    student loan repayment plan and you want to get your annual income as small as

    to hire one, as we’ll get to in chapter 6), but they are *not* cheap. If you’re
    just starting out and your net worth isn’t that high yet, I don’t necessarily
    recommend hiring a financial advisor right up front. (TL;DR, if you don’t have
    a seven-figure net worth yet, I personally don’t think you’re going to get enough
    bang for your buck.) Seriously, just by virtue of having finished almost all of
    this chapter, you now know *so* much of what financial advisors try to teach beginners
    (go you!). Plus, independent financial advisors can leverage such high fees that
    any gains you make on your investments will get wiped right back out, so . . .
    sort of pointless.
  prefs: []

    certain percentage of what you have invested with them, and while that’s cheaper
    than finding and hiring someone on your own . . . well, it will depend on *your*
    individual scenario, of course, but from what I’ve seen, they don’t go much deeper
    or more personal in customizing your options than a DIY option like a target-date
    fund does. (They do make the fees higher, though!)

    (or just chat) with a financial advisor who works with your employer-sponsored
    retirement account. If there’s anything you don’t understand about how your company’s
    401(k) system works, what investments are available, or even what makes sense
    for you personally, then it’s worth seeing if there’s someone available to talk
    to you—and this should typically be made available to you for free.

    offered through your brokerage that use computer algorithms to analyze your financial
    situation and automatically recommend the investments and allocations that are
    best for you. They’re simple, completely legit, and an amazing way to get tailor-made
    investments in your account without having to do any of the heavy lifting yourself.
    Not all brokerages offer robo-advisors, but many of the major ones do (and if
    this is the option you think you’ll go for, then be sure that your brokerage of
    choice has these when you sign up).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A robo-advisor will start by giving you a quiz to figure out a picture of you,
    your life, and your goals (with questions like “How old are you?” and “How much
    money do you make?” and “When do you want to retire?”), and with that picture
    they determine a risk tolerance. Then, based on that risk tolerance, they make
    investment decisions on your behalf. You give them the money and they automagically
    divvy it up into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or whatever combination of investments
    they’ve calculated make sense for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what’s *extra* wonderful about robo-advisors is that they will never forget
    about you. They’ll periodically bug you to fill out a questionnaire every so often
    so that their picture of you is as up-to-date as possible. As you get older, or
    as things in your life change, your robo-advisor can rebalance your portfolio
    accordingly.

    the service (0.25 percent is usually pretty standard). That’s much less than a
    human flesh-and-blood advisor would cost (about 1 to 1.25 percent), but also more
    than just doing it yourself (free). (You can also head to [richAF.club](https://richAF.club)

- en: '**Target-date fund:** Probably my number-one pick for a self-directed account
    when you’re just starting out, these guys are an incredibly beginner-friendly
    option for buying your first shares of something, while still knowing that you’re
    making a solid choice. Target-date funds are mutual funds that are regularly rebalanced
    to a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to someone retiring in a
    given year. To find *your* target-date fund, first off, calculate what year you’ll
    turn sixty—that’s your target date. Next, log in to your brokerage and search
    “target-date fund” and look for the one with your target date (or the closest
    one to your target date—if you’re equally distant between two, just pick whichever
    one: the difference won’t be big enough to really matter). Some target-date funds
    do have minimum investment amounts, so check with your brokerage to see if that’s
    the case.'

    index funds mentioned more than a few times . . . and you’re probably like, “Okay,
    I get that they’re a good idea or whatever, but WHY. WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT.”
    So here goes: an *index* is just where certain companies’ stocks trade: things
    you’ve heard of like NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
    An index *fund* is a basket of investments that replicates all the companies in
    a particular index. So, if you’ve got an index fund based on the S&P 500, that’ll
    be a basket full of bits of those 500 companies. The index fund then acts like
    an annoying little brother and copycats whatever the index does: if big bro S&P
    500 goes up, lil bro index fund will go up. S&P goes down? Index fund will go
    down. This makes index funds, generally speaking, pretty good long-term investments,
    especially for beginners, because they’re an easy way to bet that the largest
    and most influential companies within our economy will go up over time. What you
    *won’t* get, compared to target-date funds, is that age-specific asset allocation—and
    the copycat action of index funds is less optimal when the economy, um, *temporarily*
    tanks. (Remember 2008? March 2020?) Index funds are available as mutual funds
    and as ETFs. Many index funds can be purchased as fractional shares (with less
    money overall) if you want too.'

    comfortable with using your brokerage platform and seeing the (very normal) ups
    and downs that your investments will take. What you *don’t* want to do is see
    a dip, panic, and pull all your money out of investment accounts entirely. Temporary
    dips—even bigger “market corrections”—are going to happen, and you are going to
    have to be mentally ready in order to stick this out for the long term. Remember,
    you have a diversified portfolio, not 100 percent of your money in Shitcoin or
    Beanie Babies Incorporated. You’re betting on the *overall economy*, and sometimes
    the economy takes a lil spill. And so long as you’re doing that, you’re in good
    shape: In fact, according to a recent market simulation study by NerdWallet, if
    you invest in a fund that simply tracks the growth of the economy (such as an
