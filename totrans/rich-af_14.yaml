    ready to ~mingle~. So, naturally, I spent a decent amount of my free time dating.
    One night, I ended up on a date with this one guy, and it was going pretty well—like,
    not love-at-first-sight level, but not fake-a-phone-call-to-escape level, either.
    He was cute enough, the drinks were good, it wasn’t a total waste of an evening.

    worked on Wall Street at that point—which meant I had a rough understanding of
    what he was probably making. And it was not Ferragamo-and-Hermès money. At least,

    amount every time, freelance income can be wildly variable from year to year . . .
    and because income tax is progressive, it’s not as simple as just paying twenty-two
    cents of every dollar you earn. You have to guess how much money you’ll have made
    by the end of the year, and use *that* to determine how much to send the IRS every
    three months. These payments are typically calculated on your previous years’
    income, which is at least a starting point—but, again, freelance income varies.
    It’s so easy to either under- *or* overpay.

    It literally just means you are no longer tied to a job that you don’t want to
    do. Personally, when me and my partner hit our number, I will definitely downshift
    in my creator/influencer career. I’d likely pick up a lot more philanthropic work,
    or do a job I couldn’t live off of without the supplemental income from my investments.
    For example, there’s a tiny piece of me that’s always wanted to be a social worker,
    but, transparently, social workers in New York City get paid jack shit, unfortunately.
    It’s not really a job you can take on if you are the only daughter of two immigrant

    work any longer. In other words, hitting this number means you are now able to

    Airstream people, sustain literally means “cover enough expenses to not die,”
    so maybe paying for the parking of the airstream, basic food, and maybe a pair
    of flip-flops to wear to the store. Whereas for this other person, “sustain” could
    mean covering tuition for their kids, paying all the mortgage payments on those
    homes, and spending on travel. It could mean taking care of parents or having
    a budget to go out to eat and entertain yourself and buy nice jewelry. Basically,
    if you think it’s money that you intend to spend, then it should become part of
    that number.

    way to approach calculating this number. There’s no “should,” in other words.
    It’s very much a soul-searching expedition as much as it is researching what your
    dollar-figure expenses will be. You have to think about what these things are
    going to cost every year *and* what’s important to you. (Also, it’s okay if it’s
    a rough estimate to start—you’re probably going to change it a few times over
    the years, which we’ll get to in a sec.)

    4 percent return on investments, and here’s why.
  id: totrans-330
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Four percent is an incredibly conservative investment return. (Lower than the
    7 percent rule we saw earlier, remember?) Even high-grade, low-risk bonds can
    yield you 4 percent annually (and at the time of this writing, even 100 percent
    risk-free high-yield savings accounts—where your money is FDIC-insured up to $250,000—are
    paying 4 percent or more). But assuming your asset allocation isn’t totally unhinged
    (like 100 percent in crypto), you can almost certainly count on making 4 percent
    annually on average—some years you’ll get 15 percent and some years you’ll get
    negative 9 percent, but *on average*, you’ll hit that 4 percent, if not more.
    (Obviously, the hope is that you’d be making more than 4 percent, on average,
    to account for things like any capital gains taxes or unexpected sudden jumps
    in cost of living, but again—if you *plan* for 4 percent, anything above that
    is a pleasant surprise.)

- en: 'This very conservative number will also help to account for inflation: if,
    over time, you’re only making a certain return, and that return is *less* than
    what inflation is, you’re going to end up with less money than you initially started
    with, and as that number gets smaller and smaller, your returns may not be able
    to cover your annual costs.'

- en: First off, I’m not saying you need to retire early and stop earning money with
    work, remember? Again, rich people love doing more of a gradual fade-out. Instead
    of quitting the working world forever, they just change the job they do. They
    get to that point where they don’t need to be hustling trying to make a million
    dollars a year, but having $50,000 come in the door when you’re just leisurely
    working or doing something part-time? It’s not a bad gig at all.

    for example, walk dogs on Wag? You can go for your thirty-minute walk in the morning,
    your thirty-minute walk at night, and happen to hold somebody’s dog’s leash at
    the same time, *and* continue to have money coming in the door. It’s money that
    you don’t need, but it’s nice to have, especially if you were going to go for
    that walk anyway.

- en: To get more nitty-gritty, you can do this FU calculation for a few different
    flavors of effing off. You can have your bare-bones number, the one where you’ll
    be able to say, “When I hit this, I’m going to downshift in my career and pick
    a job that I actually like, but I’ll def still be working.” You can have your
    no-more-work-period number, where you’re saying, “At this number I’m going to
    retire fully, and instead of working I’m going to focus on my family.” And then
    you can have a number that’s literally like, “When I hit this number, you hoes
    will never hear from me again, I’m moving to the south of France, peace, goodbye.”

    Because that way, when you go to work every day, you know what your goals are,
    and how close you are to each of them—and those goals essentially give you something
    to work for. Just figure out those tiers of annual spending and redo the calculation
    the same way.

    your life evolves. If you decide to expand your family, if you move somewhere
    more expensive, if you adopt a pet, if you develop a long-term condition or suddenly
    need to care for a family member, that number will get a lot higher. Those kiddos
    and golden retriever mean you can’t drive that Prius into the ground anymore;
    you’re gonna have to go for the Toyota Sienna and make sure you’re budgeting for
    Champ’s heartworm meds.

    to start. If you highball your projected annual expenses and lowball your expected
    investment returns, you’re planning for the worst, but will in all likelihood
    get something better than the most dire situation when it all shakes out.

    give it that periodic true-up. Reevaluate what you want out of life, what you
    need to stay stable, and what that’s all going to cost, and recalculate your number
    accordingly. Do this whenever you have a major life change (marriage, kids, new
    job) or at least once a year. (Easy rule: review your FU number whenever you’re
    reevaluating your health insurance, whether it’s for a qualifying event or just
    your annual confirmation of coverage.)'

    ever. Still, my partner and I sat down for an honest conversation about what our
    FU number would be: basically, if we want to have two children, pay for them to
    get the best education possible, have a beautiful primary residence and one, maybe
    two vacation homes, what are we talking here? We figured that to be really super
