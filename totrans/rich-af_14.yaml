    or other lines of credit you have, don’t miss payments—even by a day, and even
    if you can only swing the minimum. If you’re a bit of a space cadet with deadlines,
    then keep a cash cushion in your bill-pay checking account and set your bills
    to auto pay every month. And if you’re accidentally late with a single payment?
    Call your bank and ask if they’ll remove it from your record as a one-time courtesy.'

    and 10 percent. 30 percent is the red-flag number: once you start using more than
    30 percent of your available credit, your credit score will take a hit. (So, for
    example, if you have a credit card with a $10,000 limit and carry more than $3,000
    on it.) Ten percent, on the other hand (so, carrying about $1,000 on that card)
    is more what lenders like to see: this shows that you’re actively using the card
    (which is good) but not going crazy and racking up charges. Keep your utilization
    in that friendly zone for a few months and you should see your score increase.'

    might *think* that the only way to decrease your credit utilization is to pay
    down that debt . . . but it’s not. Remember, credit utilization is a percentage—a
    fraction. So if you make the bottom number (your credit limit) bigger, you can
    magically shrink your utilization, even if the top number (how much you spend
    and owe) stays the same. Every six to twelve months, call your credit card company
    and ask for a credit limit increase—*especially* if your income has increased
    since you opened your card. Many times, if you’re in decent standing with them,
    they’ll bump you up on the spot.'

    If you see anything fishy, that you don’t recognize, or that’s wrong, contact
    the credit bureau ASAP and let them know what’s wrong. They’ll investigate, make

    it’s essentially a card with a security deposit, where you send the company a
    cash deposit up front as collateral. Lots of secured credit cards will also charge
    an annual fee—usually somewhere between twenty-five and ninety-nine dollars annually—in
    addition to that security deposit, but that can be a price *totally* worth paying:
    with a secured credit card, if you are able to spend wisely, don’t max your limit,

    a required amount of education and hands-on experience, and comply with a strict
    set of ethical rules and codes of conduct. I don’t think I need to explain why

    of “financial independence, retire early” is that you get to a savings number
    that’s large enough that you can live off of the investment returns annually and
    you can literally never work again. But for a lot of FIRE people, what ends up
    happening is that they hit that FIRE number, and then they become a FIRE guru.
    They set up a blog or a course and teach other people how to hit their FIRE numbers.
  prefs: []

    FIRE means you’ve retired early, right? You are no longer working, you are not
    making income through labor because you are living off of investment income. So
    if you quit your job as an accountant because you’ve hit financial independence,
    but then you start teaching a “How to FIRE” course . . . IDK, but that doesn’t
    sound like retirement to me. That just sounds like you found a new job that you
    like better.

    as someone who literally quit my day job to teach finance for a living—but call
    a spade a spade. If you’re “FIREd” but actively taking dollars from people in
    exchange for your sharing FIRE wisdom, you’re still making money by working. You’re
    making money differently, and maybe you now have a job that has a lot more work/life
    flexibility, but you’re still working. You have *not* retired early.

    all just sitting on their asses sipping martinis. They are putting in effort and

    of retiring early. Getting to that number ultimately has zero to do with retirement.
    It literally just means you are no longer tied to a job that you don’t want to
    do. Personally, when me and my partner hit our number, I will definitely downshift
    in my creator/influencer career. I’d likely pick up a lot more philanthropic work,
    or do a job I couldn’t live off of without the supplemental income from my investments.
    For example, there’s a tiny piece of me that’s always wanted to be a social worker,
    but, transparently, social workers in New York City get paid jack shit, unfortunately.
    It’s not really a job you can take on if you are the only daughter of two immigrant
    parents whose retirement plan is you. But when I hit a number I’m fully comfortable
    with, I can do a job—like social work—that I’m just really interested in doing,
    *without* having to stress about covering my expenses.

    you hit this number, you can tell your boss F U and go do whatever you want. You
    do not need to retire, but you are not *obligated* to do a particular kind of
    work any longer. In other words, hitting this number means you are now able to
    live solely off of investment returns. You’ve stockpiled enough assets in cash
    and investments to sustain your needs until you croak.

    brand-name organic milk versus store brand, or whether it’s “Do I take this job

    and put them through college, and I want to have a vacation home in Naples so
    we can go to Florida every winter.” Both are valid dreams to have. These two people
    living their two different dreams will have *vastly* different FU numbers. And
    the numbers can change over time, too—like, say you want to have the vacation

    of flip-flops to wear to the store. Whereas for this other person, “sustain” could
    mean covering tuition for their kids, paying all the mortgage payments on those
    homes, and spending on travel. It could mean taking care of parents or having

    7 percent rule we saw earlier, remember?) Even high-grade, low-risk bonds can
    yield you 4 percent annually (and at the time of this writing, even 100 percent
    risk-free high-yield savings accounts—where your money is FDIC-insured up to $250,000—are
    paying 4 percent or more). But assuming your asset allocation isn’t totally unhinged
    (like 100 percent in crypto), you can almost certainly count on making 4 percent
    annually on average—some years you’ll get 15 percent and some years you’ll get
    negative 9 percent, but *on average*, you’ll hit that 4 percent, if not more.
    (Obviously, the hope is that you’d be making more than 4 percent, on average,
    to account for things like any capital gains taxes or unexpected sudden jumps
    in cost of living, but again—if you *plan* for 4 percent, anything above that
    is a pleasant surprise.)

    over time, you’re only making a certain return, and that return is *less* than

    with, and as that number gets smaller and smaller, your returns may not be able
    to cover your annual costs.'

    of quitting the working world forever, they just change the job they do. They
    get to that point where they don’t need to be hustling trying to make a million
    dollars a year, but having $50,000 come in the door when you’re just leisurely
    working or doing something part-time? It’s not a bad gig at all.

    a job that I actually like, but I’ll def still be working.” You can have your
    no-more-work-period number, where you’re saying, “At this number I’m going to
    retire fully, and instead of working I’m going to focus on my family.” And then
    you can have a number that’s literally like, “When I hit this number, you hoes
    will never hear from me again, I’m moving to the south of France, peace, goodbye.”

    the same way.

    your life evolves. If you decide to expand your family, if you move somewhere
    more expensive, if you adopt a pet, if you develop a long-term condition or suddenly
    need to care for a family member, that number will get a lot higher. Those kiddos
