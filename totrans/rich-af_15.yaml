    the FAFSA—the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Not because my family
    was ultra wealthy, or anything—we were solidly middle-class. My parents had big
    expectations for me in college, and loans would’ve made that massive education
    bill a lot easier to stomach.

    osmosis. The same way you happen to hold your pencil weird like your mom, or you

    “playing the stock market” or even being born rich (remember my trash date with
    the credit card debt?). What it does mean is deeply understanding yourself, your
    goals for your money, and what’s standing in the way of those two. Yes, you can
    do tons of research on the rules of how investing works and which banks give you
    the best HYSA rates, but ultimately, that Rich AF strategy you need to succeed

    one grab bag of wisdom before you go, like the gift bags they hand out at the

    some point during your life, and the true pearl of Rich AF wisdom that proves
    them wrong. (Sure, they might not be as tinfoil-hat-y as my dad’s anti-FAFSA stance,

    convinced that cash is king no matter what, your parents may have taught you that
    money should stay, basically, in your line of sight at all times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This wealth-hoarding mentality can come from a genuine place of wanting to protect
    and provide for you. If money was tight, your parents may have been afraid to
    invest their money and lose (or even just lose access to) whatever small cushion
    of cash they had saved up. It doesn’t matter how much they knew about investing
    and it being a “good idea” if they genuinely couldn’t spare even ten bucks without
    the power getting turned off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But more likely, there was a serious knowledge gap. Rich people know that just
    sitting on a pile of cash (literally or figuratively) is not going to get you
    rich, because it prevents your money from making you money—but how are regular
    people supposed to find that out? Your family may have been wary of investing
    their money or using a bank due to fear of fraud or being scammed, because they
    weren’t aware, for example, that deposits are FDIC insured (aka backed by the
    government) or that there are lower-risk investment options than just buying a
    single company’s stock. They may not have known how to get started, and therefore
    felt more comfortable hoarding their wealth instead of puzzling out how to set
    up a brokerage account. They may have assumed all investing is either “playing
    the stock market” or “giving twenty grand to Uncle Tony’s friend to get his new
    restaurant off the ground” and not unreasonably been like . . . nah—I’m out.

    of investing with a lot of skepticism. You might get defensive very quickly when
    confronted with suggestions for how to level up your finances, or take advice
    personally as an insult to your abilities to “be a good saver.”

    *and* you can adapt as that situation changes. You won’t be able to control everything—investing
    always has some risk—but you can control what *you* do. And you have what it takes

    our lives tolerable, even *enjoyable*—and guess what? That’s also okay. You may

    on candy or a new Hello Kitty notepad instead of something practical, they might
    chide you with “You’re so wasteful with your money—candy doesn’t last!” or “You
    should be saving your money instead of spending it, you know.” That kind of language

    the “lessons” you learned about value from your parents. Spending money we don’t

    mental gymnastics, so it’s likely your parents verbalized their reasoning to you

    or they may have been afraid of taking risks with their finances. They may have
    felt like their current job or salary was the best they could do and that negotiating
