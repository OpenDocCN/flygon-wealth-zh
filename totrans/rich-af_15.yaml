    the FAFSA—the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Not because my family

    money should stay, basically, in your line of sight at all times.

- en: This wealth-hoarding mentality can come from a genuine place of wanting to protect
    and provide for you. If money was tight, your parents may have been afraid to
    invest their money and lose (or even just lose access to) whatever small cushion
    of cash they had saved up. It doesn’t matter how much they knew about investing
    and it being a “good idea” if they genuinely couldn’t spare even ten bucks without
    the power getting turned off.

  zh: 这种囤积财富的心态可能源自真正想要保护和供养你的愿望。如果钱紧张，你的父母可能害怕投资他们的钱并丢失（甚至只是失去对他们积攒的一点点现金的访问权）。无论他们对投资和“是个好主意”有多了解，如果他们真的连十美元都舍不得花，而电费就会被切断，那就无关紧要。
- en: But more likely, there was a serious knowledge gap. Rich people know that just
    sitting on a pile of cash (literally or figuratively) is not going to get you
    rich, because it prevents your money from making you money—but how are regular
    people supposed to find that out? Your family may have been wary of investing
    their money or using a bank due to fear of fraud or being scammed, because they
    weren’t aware, for example, that deposits are FDIC insured (aka backed by the
    government) or that there are lower-risk investment options than just buying a
    single company’s stock. They may not have known how to get started, and therefore
    felt more comfortable hoarding their wealth instead of puzzling out how to set
    up a brokerage account. They may have assumed all investing is either “playing
    the stock market” or “giving twenty grand to Uncle Tony’s friend to get his new
    restaurant off the ground” and not unreasonably been like . . . nah—I’m out.

    chide you with “You’re so wasteful with your money—candy doesn’t last!” or “You
