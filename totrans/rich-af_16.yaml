    let it be this: there is nothing more important than who you surround yourself
    with. I am so incredibly lucky because my entire career, and frankly my entire
    existence, has been nothing but a series of serendipitous moments where the people
    in my life have supported me and given me opportunities to succeed. This book
    is a perfect example of just that.'

    Thank you to Alex Devlin at WME and Rana Zand and Kristen McGuinness at Range
